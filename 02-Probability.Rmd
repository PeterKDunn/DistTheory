"In probability, sets represent events, or collections of possible outcomes, and may describe discrete lists, continuous intervals, or more complex regions."




## Introduction {#IntroductionToProbability}

A foundation in set theory allows the idea of probability to be developed.
Probability is a way of describing how likely it is for some event to occur.
Probability relies heavily on many of the ideas from set theory.

Building upon this foundation, probability relates to the outcomes of *random processes* (or *random experiments*).


:::{.definition #RandomProcess name="Random process"}
A **random process** (or **random experiment**) is a procedure that:

* can be repeated, in theory, indefinitely under essentially identical conditions; and
* has well-defined outcomes; and
* the outcome of any individual repetition is unpredictable.
:::


Examples of simple *random processes* include tossing a coin, or rolling a die.
While the outcome of any instance of a random process produces is unknown, the possible outcomes are known.


## Sample spaces {#SampleSpaces}

When talking about probability, the [*universal set*](#def:UniversalSet) is the set of all possible outcomes that can result from a random process, usually denoted  $S$, $\Omega$ or $U$.


::: {.definition #SampleSpace name="Sample space"}
A *sample space* (or *event space*, or *outcome space*) for a random process is a set of all possible outcomes from a random process, usually denoted by $S$, $\Omega$ or $U$ (for the 'universal set').
:::


:::{.example #SampleSpaceDice name="Sample space"}
Consider rolling a die.
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes:
$$
  S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}.
$$
:::


As with sets, the sample space may be finite, or countably infinite, or uncountably infinite.
When the sample space is finite or countably infinite, the sample space is called *discrete*.
If a sample space is an uncountably finite set, the sample space is called *continuous*.


:::{.example #SampleSpaceDiceDiscrete name="Discrete sample space"}
The sample space in Example\ \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDice) is *discrete*.
:::


:::{.example #SampleSpaceCont name="Continuous sample space"}
Consider the height of students.
The sample space is *continuous* (see Example\ \@ref(exm:HeightsOfPeople)).
:::



## Events and probability {#EventsAndProbability}

### Simple events {#SimpleEvents}

While the sample space defines the set of *all* possible outcomes, usually we are interested in just some of those elements of the sample space.
Events are *subsets* of the sample space (and hence are also sets).


::: {.definition #Event name="Event"}
An event $E$ is a subset of $S$, and we write $E \subseteq S$.
:::


By this definition, $S$ itself is an event.
If the sample space is a finite or countable infinite set, then an event is a collection of sample points.


:::{.example #TwoCoinToss name="Events"}
Consider the simple random process of tossing a coin twice.
The [sample space](#def:SampleSpace) is the set
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '$$S = \\{ (\\Heads, \\Heads), 
              (\\Heads, \\Tails),
              (\\Tails, \\Heads),
              (\\Tails, \\Tails)\\},$$'
} else {
'$$S = \\{ (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)\\},$$'
}`
where
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '$\\Heads$'
} else {
   'H'
}`
represents tossing a head and 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '$\\Tails$'
} else {
   'T'
}`
represents tossing a tail, and the pair lists the result of the two tosses *in order*.

We can define the event $A$ as 'tossing a head on the second toss', and list the elements:
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '$$A = \\{ (\\Heads, \\Heads), 
              (\\Tails, \\Heads)\\};$$'
} else {
   '$$A = \\{ (H, H), (T, H)\\};$$'
}`
notice that $A \subset S$ (i.e., $A$ is a proper subset of\ $S$).

The event $T$, defined as 'the set of outcomes corresponding to tossing *three* heads', is the [*null* or *empty set*](#def:EmptySet); no sample points have three heads.
That is, $T = \varnothing$.
:::


::: {.definition #ElementaryEvent name="Elementary event"}
In a sample space with a finite or countable infinite number of elements, an *elementary event* (or a *simple event*) is an event with one sample point, that cannot be decomposed into smaller events.
:::


:::{.example #ElementaryEvents name="Elementary events"}
Consider observing the outcome on a single roll of a die (Example\ \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDice)), where the sample space is the set of all possible outcomes:
$$
  S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}.
$$
The six elementary events are:
\begin{align*}
   E_1 = \{1\}&\quad \text{(i.e., roll a 1)}; & E_2 = \{2\}:&\quad \text{(i.e., roll a 2)};\\
   E_3 = \{3\}&\quad \text{(i.e., roll a 3)}; & E_2 = \{4\}:&\quad \text{(i.e., roll a 4)};\\
   E_5 = \{5\}&\quad \text{(i.e., roll a 5)}; & E_2 = \{6\}:&\quad \text{(i.e., roll a 6)}.
\end{align*}
:::


An important concept is that of an *occurrence* of an event.


::: {.definition #Occurence name="Occurrence"}
An event $A$ *occurs* on a particular trial of a [random process](#def:RandomProcess) if the outcome of the trial is an element of the subset\ $A$ from the random process.
:::


### Compound events {#CompoundEvents}

Simple events usually not of great interest; events of interest usually contains many elements of the sample space.
These are called *compound events*.


::: {.definition #CompoundEvents name="Compound event"}
A collection of elementary events is sometimes called a *compound event*.
:::


Since compound events, like all events, are *sets*, operations on existing sets (Sect.\ 
\@ref(RelationshipsBetweenSets)) can be used to define compound events.



:::{.example #ElementaryCompoundEvents name="Elementary and compound events"}
Consider observing the outcome on a single roll of a die, as shown in Example\ \@ref(exm:ElementaryEvents).

Define the event $T$ as 'numbers divisible by\ $3$' and event $D$ as 'numbers divisible by\ $2$'. 
$T$ and $D$ are compound events:
$$
   T =\{E_3, E_6\} = \{3, 6 \}
   \quad
   \text{and}
   \quad
   D = \{E_2, E_4, E_6\} = \{2, 4, 6 \}.
$$
:::


The set operations in Sect.\ \@ref(RelationshipsBetweenSets) apply to events, because events are sets.
However, different language is usually used, to indicate that events are real outcomes, whereas as sets are for describing structures more widely and abstractly (Table\ \@ref(tab:CompareLanguage)).
For example, 'disjoint' is used for *sets* (Sect.\ \@ref(RelationshipsBetweenSets)), whereas 'mutually exclusive' is used when referring to *events*.


::: {.definition #MutuallyExclusive name="Mutually exclusive"}
Events $A$ and $B$ are *mutually exclusive* if, and only if, $A\cap B = \varnothing$; that is, they have no outcomes in common.
That is, Events $A$ and $B$ are *mutually exclusive* if the corresponding sets are disjoint.

:::{.example #TwoCoinToss2 name="Tossing a coin twice"}
Consider the simple random process of tossing a coin twice (Example\ \@ref(exm:TwoCoinToss)), and define events $M$ and $N$ as follows:

**Event**                 | **Notation** | **Set**
--------------------------|:------------:|:-----------------:
'Obtain a Head on Toss 1' |     $M$      | $\{(HT), (HH)\}$
'Obtain a Tail on Toss 1' |     $N$      | $\{(TT), (TH)\}$

The two sets are *disjoint*, as there are no sample points in common.
The events are therefore *mutually exclusive*.
:::


Since events are really just sets, the set algebra in Sect.\ \@ref(SetAlgebra) applies to events also.





:::{.example #RollDie name="Rolling a die"}
Suppose we roll a single, six-sided die.
For rolling a die, the sample space is $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
We can define these two events:
\begin{align*}
   E = \text{An even number is thrown}         &= \{2, 4, \phantom{5, }6\};\\
   G = \text{A number larger than 3 is thrown} &= \{\phantom{2,\ }4, 5, 6\}.
\end{align*}
Then, the following compound events could be defined:
\begin{align*}
   E \cap G       &= \{4, 6\}      &    E \cup G  &= \{ 2, 4, 5, 6\}\\
   E^c            &= \{ 1, 3, 5\}  &    G^c       &= \{ 1, 2, 3\}.
\end{align*}
We can make other observations too:
\begin{align*}
   E \cap G^c
   &= \{2, 4, 6\} \cap \{ 1, 2, 3\} = \{ 2 \};\\
   E^c \cap G^c
   &= \{1, 3, 5\} \cap \{ 1, 2, 3\} = \{ 1, 3 \}.
\end{align*}

:::{.example #CricketBallEvents name="Throwing a cricket ball"}
Consider throwing a cricket ball, where the distance of the throw (in metres) is of interest (Example\ \@ref(exm:CricketBallDefine)).
We could define the sample space\ $D$ as $D = \{ d \in \mathbb{R} \mid d \ge 0 \}$.
More practically, we could write
$$
  D = \{ d \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 < d < 150 \}
$$
given that throwing a cricket ball greater than $150\ms$ is effectively impossible (it has never been recorded), and throwing a cricket ball exactly $0\ms$ is also impossible in practice.

We can define these two events:
\begin{align*}
   B_1 &= \{b \in S \mid b \ge 40\} &&\quad \text{(i.e., throw a cricket ball at least $40\ms$)};\\
   B_2 &= \{b \in S \mid b < 50\}   &&\quad \text{(i.e., throw a cricket ball less than $50\ms$)}.
\end{align*}
Then:
\begin{align*}
   B_1 \cap B_2   &= \{b\in S \mid 40\le b<50\}\quad \text{(i.e., throw the ball at least $40$m but less than $50\ms$)};\\

### Probabiity {#ProbabilityDefinition}

Usually, we are interested in how likely it is for various outcomes from a random experiment to occur. 
That is, how likely it is to observe any of the various events defined on the sample space.
*Probability* is the mathematical term for quantifying this likelihood.
The *probability* of an event $E$ occurring is denoted $\text{Pr}(E)$.


:::{.definition #Probability name="Probability"}
*Probability* is a function that assigns a number to an event.
That is, for some event\ $E$, the value $\Pr(E)$ represents the probability that event\ $E$ occurs.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The probability of an event $E$ occurring can be denoted as $\text{P}(E)$, $\text{Pr}(E)$, $\text{Pr}\{E\}$, or using other similar notation.
:::


This definition in Def.\ \@ref(def:Probability) allows *any* number to be assigned to an event, without rules or restrictions ('assigns a number').
Some restrictions must be placed on the numbers that can be assigned to make this definition workable and practical.

While we have defined probability as a function that assigns a number to an event, we have not stated what numbers can be assigned as a 'probability'.
What values should a probability take?
How should these numerical likelihoods be assigned?

A rigorous foundation for probability is found by using three fundamental axioms, called the *Axioms of Probability*.
Using these axioms, *all* other rules about probability can be derived.
These axioms formally define the rules that apply to all probabilities.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
An **axiom** is a self-evident truth that does not require proof, or cannot be proven.
They form the starting point for building further proofs.
:::


:::{.definition #ThreeAxioms name="Kolmogorov's three axioms of probability"}
Consider a sample space $S$ for a random process, and an event\ $A$ in $S$ so that $A\subseteq S$.
For every event\ $A$ (a subset of\ $S$), a number $\Pr(A)$ can be assigned which is called the *probability* of event $A$.

Kolmogorov's three axioms of probability are:

1. *Non-negativity*: $\Pr(A) \ge 0$.  
   The probability of any event is a non-negative real number.
2. *Exhaustive*: $\Pr(S) = 1$.  
   The event that *something* happens has probability\ $1$ (i.e., is certain), since the sample space lists *all* possible outcomes. 
3. *Additivity*: If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are two mutually exclusive events in $S$ (i.e., $A_1 \cap A_2 = \varnothing$), then
$$
      \Pr(A_1 \cup A_2) = \Pr(A_1) + \Pr(A_2).
$$
:::


These purpose of these axioms is to formally define probability and the the rules that apply to probabilities.
These axioms of probability can be used to develop all other probability formulae.
For example, these properties follow from these three axioms, for any Events\ $A$ and\ $B$ defined on a sample space\ $S$:

* **Bounds**:  
  $0 \le \Pr(A)\le 1$; that is, probabilities are numbers between zero and one inclusive for any event\ $A$.
* **Empty sets**:  
  $\Pr(\varnothing) = 0$; that is, the probability of an impossible event is zero.
* **Monotonicity**:  
  If $A\subseteq B$, then $\Pr(A) \le \Pr(B)$; that is, if every outcome in event\ $A$ is also in event\ $B$, then the probability of\ $A$ cannot exceed the probability of\ $B$.

* **Complements**:  
  $\Pr(A^c) = 1 - Pr(A)$; that is, the probability that event\ $A$ *does not* happens is\ $1$ minus the probability that it *does* happen.
* **Addition**:  
  $\Pr(A_1 \cup A_2) = \Pr(A_1) + \Pr(A_2) - \Pr(A_1 \cap A_2)$, a more general result than the third axiom.

All of these can be proven using only the three axioms and the definitions that have been presented so far.


::: {.example #UsingAxioms name="Proof: using the axioms"}
We only prove the empty theorem result: $\Pr(\varnothing) = 0$.
While this may appear 'obvious', it is not one of the three axioms.

By definition, the empty set $\varnothing$ contain no outcomes; hence $\varnothing \cup A = A$ for any event $A$; the two events are [mutually exclusive](#def:MutuallyExclusive).

So, by the third axiom, $\varnothing\cap A = \varnothing$, as $\varnothing$ and $A$ are mutually exclusive.
Hence, by the [third axiom](#def:ThreeAxioms)  
\begin{equation}
   \Pr(\varnothing\cup A) = \Pr(\varnothing) + \Pr(A).
   (\#eq:ByThirdAxiom)
\end{equation}
But since $\varnothing \cup A = A$, then $\Pr(\varnothing \cup A) = \Pr(A)$, and so $\Pr(A) = \Pr(\varnothing) + \Pr(A)$ from Eq.\ \@ref(eq:ByThirdAxiom).
Hence $\Pr(\varnothing) = 0$.
:::

While this result may have seemed obvious, *all* probability formulae can be developed just from assuming the three axioms of probability.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The three axioms dictate that a probability is a real value between\ $0$ and\ $1$.
Other ways also exists to quantify the likelihood of an event occuring.
For example, sometimes the chance of an event occurring is expressed as *odds*, which are *not* the same as probabilities.
Odds are the ratio of how often an event is likely to occur, to how often the event is likely to *not occur*.

Importantly: 'odds' and 'probability' are not the same.
The three axioms define the rules that all probabilities must follow.
:::


Having seen these axioms, and the rules that follow from them, we can now consider *how* to determine the probability assigned to certain events.
\index{Axioms of probability|)}


## Assigning probabilities: discrete samples spaces {#AssignProbDiscrete}

Developing a method of assigning a probability to an event is difficult.
However, for *discrete sample spaces*, two options are:

* finding probabilities using *classical probability* (Sect.\ \@ref(ClassicalProb)).\index{Probability!Classical probability}
  This approach works when the simple events in the sample space are equally likely (i.e., there is no reason to suspect one outcome is more likely that any other).
* *estimating* probabilities using *relative-frequency* (Sect.\ \@ref(EmpiricalApproach)), when trials can be repeated many times.\index{Probability!Relative frequency probability}

**THIRD OR NOT????**
When neither symmetry nor data is available, we may use subjective probability — a personal degree of belief.


### Classical probability {#ClassicalProb}

For a discrete sample space,\index{Probability!Classical probability} *where all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely* (i.e., there is no reason to suspect one outcome is more likely that any other), the probability of an event\ $E$ is defined as
$$
  \Pr(E) 
  = \frac{|E|}{|S|} 
  = \frac{\text{The number of elements in $E$}}{\text{The number of elements in $S$}},
$$
 
where $|\cdot|$ refers to the cardinality notation (Sect.\ \@ref(Cardinality)).

A probability of\ $0$ is assigned to an event that *never* occurs (i.e., $E$ corresponds to an *impossible* event), and\ $1$ to an event that is *certain* to occur (i.e., $E$ corresponds to the universal set).
Notice that this approach conforms to the restriction on probabilities as numbers between\ $0$ and\ $1$ inclusive, a result that follows from the three axioms of probability.


### Relative frequency (empirical) approach {#EmpiricalApproach}

The mathematical definition\index{Probability!Relative frequency probability} of probability through our axioms describe the *properties* of a probability measure. The classical definition of probability naturally satisfies these axioms, but requires equally-likely outcomes in the sample space\ $S$.

However, outcomes are rarely equally likely; the probability of 'receiving rain tomorrow' is not always the same as the probability of 'not receiving rain tomorrow'.
When a random process can be repeated many times, counting the number of times the event of interest occurs means we can compute the *proportion* of times the event occurs.
Mathematically, if the random process is repeated\ $n$ times, and event\ $E$ occurs in\ $m$ of these ($m < n$), then the *probability* of the event occurring is
$$
   \Pr(E) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{m}{n}.
$$
In practice, $n$ needs to be very large---and the repetitions random---to compute probabilities with accuracy.
In practice then, only approximate probabilities can be found (since\ $n$ is finite in practice).

This is the *relative frequency* (or *empirical*) approach to probability.

This method cannot always be used in practice.
Consider the probability that the air bag in a car correctly deploys in a crash.
Crashing thousands of cars is not financially viable to estimate the probability that the air bag correctly deploying.
Fortunately, car manufacturers can crash a small numbers of cars to get a very appoximate indications of the probabilities of correct air bag deployment.
Sometimes, computer simulations can be used to approximate the probabilities.

Again, a probability of\ $0$ is assigned to an event that *never* occurs (i.e., $E$ corresponds to an *impossible* event), and\ $1$ to an event that is *certain* to occur (i.e., $E$ corresponds to the universal set), as $n\to\infty$.
Notice that this approach conforms to the restriction on probabilities as numbers between\ $0$ and\ $1$ inclusive, a result that follows from the three axioms of probability.


::: {.example #SalkVaccine name="Salk vaccine"}
In 1954, Jonas Salk developed a vaccine against polio (@book:Williams:BioStats, \S1.1.3).
To test the effectiveness of the vaccine, the data in Table\ \@ref(tab:Polio) were collected.

The relative frequency approach can be used to *estimate* the probabilities of developing polio *with* the vaccine and *without* the vaccine (the control group):
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(\text{develop polio in control group}) 
   &\approx \frac{115}{201\,229} = 0.000571;\\[3pt]
   \Pr(\text{develop polio in vaccinated group}) 
   &\approx \frac{33}{200\,745} = 0.000164,
\end{align*}
where '$\approx$' means 'approximately equal to'.
The estimated *probability* of contracting polio in the control group is about 3.5 times greater than in the control group.
The precision of these sample estimates could be quantified by producing a [confidence interval for the proportions](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-Textbook/CIOneProportion.html).

## Assigning probabilities: continuous sample spaces {#AssignProbContinuous}

Events defined on a continuous sample space do not have elements that can be counted (Sect.\ \@ref(InfiniteSets)), so different means are needed to compute probabilities in these situations.
In fact, for a continuous sample space, the probability of observing any specific, individual outcome has probability\ $0$.
So, for a continuous sample space\ $S = \mathbb{R}$, the events
\begin{align*}
   A &= \{x \in S \mid 10 < x < 20\},\\
   B &= \{x \in S \mid 10 \le x < 20\},\\
   C &= \{x \in S \mid 10 < x \le 20\}\quad\text{and}\\
   D &= \{x \in S \mid 10 \le x \le 20\}
\end{align*}
all have the same probability.
In a continuous sample space, the probability of observing any single value (such as observing exactly\ $10$) is zero. 
So, whether these endpoints of the interval are included or excluded, the probability is the same.

This means that a probability is not (and cannot be) based on counting elements for continuous sample spaces.
Instead, a *probability density function* (or pdf)\index{Pdf} is used to describe how the probability is assigned across the sample space.
A pdf is defined over the sample space, and quantifies the concentration of probability in different regions of the sample space.

For example, consider the heights of adult females (Example\ \@ref(exm:HeightsOfPeople)).
Every female has a height, so the sample space\ $S$ of the heights of all females can be defined as, for instance,
$$
   S = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 50 < x < 300\},
$$
where $x$ is the height in centimetres.
We have assumed no height less than $50\cms$ (the shortest-ever recorded height of an adult female is greater than this) or greater than $300\cms$ (the tallest-ever recorded height of an adult female is less than this). 
Since this is the sample space\ $S$, the probability of event\ $S$ is one (by the third axiom of probability; Sect.\ \@ref(ProbabilityAxioms)): we are certain that the height of any given woman is in\ $S$.
That is, the total probability over\ $S$ is one; every adult female is represented somewhere within\ $S$.

Now consider how that total probability of one could be distributed to various ranges of heights.
The probability of finding an adult female with a height less than $75\cms$ (or\ $29\inches$) is basically impossible. 
Almost no probability will be concentrated below\ $75\cms$.

The probability of finding an adult female with a height less than $150\cms$ (or $4\ft$ $11\inches$) is unlikely, but is possible.
Thus, only a little of the probability will be concentrated below\ $150\cms$.

Likewise, the probability of finding an adult female with a height greater than $300\cms$ (or $9\ft$ $10\inches$) is practically impossible.
Almost no probability will be concentrated above\ $300\cms$.

The probability of finding an adult female with a height greater than $200\cms$ (or $6\ft$ $7\inches$) is unlikely but not impossible; only a little of the probability will be concentrated above\ $200\cms$.

In contrast, the probability of finding an adult female with a height between\ $150\cms$ and\ $200\cms$ is *very* high; almost all of the probability will be concentrated between\ $150\cms$ and\ $200\cms$. 
We can draw a picture that represents this concentration of probability (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:HeightsConcentrations), left panel).
This figure shows how the probability is concentrated, or allocated, or *distributed*, over the sample space.

The total probability over\ $S$ is one.
In the context of a continuous sample space, this means that the total *area under the graph* (i.e., the shaded areas in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:HeightsConcentrations)) must be equal to one.

Rather than dividing the sample space into just five large intervals of height, a finer division of heights could be used; for instance, Fig.\ \@ref(fig:HeightsConcentrations) (right panel) uses the same ideas but with $10\cms$\ intervals of heights.
This representation shows that most of the probability is concentrated\ $155\cms$ to $165\cms$, suggesting that finding an adult female with a height in this range has a relatively high probability.
Again, the total probability over\ $S$ is one, so the total *area under the graph* (i.e., the shaded area) must be equal to one.

In a pdf, intervals of the (continuous) sample space represent events, and areas under the curve represent probabilities.
:::

As the intervals become smaller, the graph showing the allocations of probability become smoother (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:HeightsConcentrationsSmooth)).
This smooth curve, say $f(x)$, is called a *probability density function* (or pdf): it shows the density (or concentration) of probability over various ranges of the sample space.
Then, the *integral* over the sample space\ $S$ must equal one:
$$

With continuous sample spaces, the probability of observing some event\ $E$ is assigned to an *interval* on the sample space\ $S$.
The probability of event\ $E$ is
$$
   \Pr(E) = \int_E f(x)\,dx.
$$

The three [axioms of probability](#AxiomaticApproach) still apply for continuous sample space, though
the equivalent statement involves *integration* of the density function $f(x)$ over the sample space\ $S$ rather than *summations*:

1. Non-negativity: integration over any region of the sample space must never produce a negative value, and so $f(x) \ge 0$ for *all* values of $x$.
2. Exhaustive: Over the whole sample space, the probability function must integrate to one:
$$
     \int_S f(x)\,dx = 1.
$$
3. Additivity: The probability of the union of any non-overlapping regions is the sum of the individual regions:
$$
  \int_{A_1} f(x)\, dx + \int_{A_2} f(x)\, dx  = \int_{A_1 \cup A_2} f(x)\, dx.
$$

Using these axioms implies a probability function for some event $A$ is defined on the continuous sample space $S$ as
$$
   \Pr(X\in A) = \int_{A(x)} f_X(x)\, dx.
$$


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The probability function $f_X(x)$ does **not** give the probability of observing the value $X = x$.
Because the sample space has an infinite number of elements, the probability of observing any single point is zero.
Instead, probabilities are computed for *intervals*.

This implies that $f_X(x) > 1$ may be true for some values of $x$, provided the total area over the sample space is one.

:::{.example #ContinuousProbs name="Assigning probabilities"}
Suppose I throw a cricket ball $100$ times, and record the distance thrown.
About $10$% of the time, the distance is at least $50$m but less than $60$m; $20$% of the time at least $40$m; $50$% of the time at least $30$m; and $100$% of the time at least $20$m.

With this information we have some idea of the probabilities that my throw goes for certain ranges of distance (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BallThrow), left panel).

For these areas to represent probabilities, though, the *total* area must sum to one.
Each rectangle has a width of 10m, and we can define the vertical-axis steps as shown as a distance of $k$ apart.

The area of each rectangle is easily found, and must sum to one; hence:
$$
  (10\times 5k) + (10\times 3k) + (10\times k) + (10\times k) = 1,
$$
so that $k = 1/100$.
With this information, we can create a rough (and coarse) probability model (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BallThrow), right panel).

## Subjective approach??????? {#SubjectiveApproach}

'Subjective' probabilities\index{Probability!subjective} are estimated after identifying the information that may influence the probability, and then evaluating and combining this information. 
You use this method when someone asks you about your team's chance of winning on the weekend.

The final (subjective) probability may, for example, be computed using mathematical models that use the relevant information.
When different people or systems identify different information as relevant, and combine them differently, different subjective probabilities eventuate.

Some examples include:

* What is the chance that an investment will return a positive yield next year?
* How likely is it that Auckland will have above average rainfall next year?

::: {.example #ChanceRain name="Subjective probability"}
What is the likelihood of rain in Charleville (a town in western Queensland) during April?
Many farmers could give a subjective estimate of the probability based on their experience and the conditions on their farm.

Using the classical approach to determine the probability is not possible.
While two outcomes are possible---it *will* rain, or it *will not* rain---these are almost certainly not *equally likely*.

A relative frequency approach could be adopted.
Data from the [Bureau of Meterology](http://www.bom.gov.au), from `r minYear` to `r maxYear` (`r numYears` years), shows rain fell in `r numAprils - numZeros` years during April.
An *approximation* to the probability is therefore $`r numAprils - numZeros` / `r numAprils` = `r round(probRain, 3)`$, or $`r round((probRain) * 100, 1)`$%.
This approach does not take into account current climatic or weather conditions, that can change every year.

## Rules of probability {#ProbabilityRules}

Many useful results can be deduced from the [three axioms](#def:ThreeAxioms) which allow probabilities to be computed in more complicated situations.


::: {.theorem #CompRule name="Complementary rule of probability"}
For any event $A$, the probability of 'not $A$' is
$$
   \Pr(A^c) = 1 - \Pr(A).
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
By the definition of the [*complement* of an event](#def:IntersectionUnionSubset), $A^c$ and $A$ are mutually exclusive.
Hence, by the [third axiom](#def:ThreeAxioms), $\Pr(A^c \cup A) = \Pr(A^c) + \Pr(A)$.

As $A^c\cup A = S$ (by definition of the complement) and $\Pr(S) = 1$ (Axiom 2), then $1 = \Pr(A^c) + \Pr(A)$, and the result follows.
:::


:::{.theorem #ProbAddition name="Addition rule of probability"}
For *any* two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of either $A$ **or** $B$ occurring is
$$
   \Pr(A\cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A\cap B).
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Exercise.
:::


If the two events are [*mutually exclusive*](#def:MutuallyExclusive), we have a corollary of Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ProbAddition).

:::{.corollary #ProbAddition}
If the two events $A$ and $B$ are *mutually exclusive*, then the probability of either $A$ **or** $B$ is
$$
   \Pr(A\cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B).
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Exercise.
:::


Some other important results that follow from the axioms are the following.

* $0 \leq \Pr(A) \leq 1$.
* For events $A$ and $B$, $\Pr(A\cup B) \leq \Pr(A) + \Pr(B)$.
* For events $A$ and $B$, if $A\subseteq B$ then $\Pr(B\cap A^c) = \Pr(B) - \Pr(A)$.
* For events $A$ and $B$, if $A\subseteq B$ then $\Pr(A) \leq \Pr(B)$.

## Conditional probability and independence {#CondProbIndependence}

### Conditional probability {#CondProb}

Assume that a sample space $S$ for the [random process](#def:RandomProcess) has been constructed, an event $A$ has been identified, and its probability, $\Pr(A)$, has been determined.
We then receive additional information that some event $B$ has occurred.
Possibly, this new information can change the value of $\Pr(A)$.

We now need to determine the probability that $A$ will occur, given that we know the information provided by event $B$.
We call this probability the *conditional probability of $A$ given $B$*, denoted by $\Pr(A \mid B)$.


:::{.example #ConditionalPrinIntro name="Conditional probability"}
Suppose I roll a die.
Define event $A$ as 'rolling a 6'.
Then, you would compute $\Pr(A) = 1/6$ (using the [classical approach](#ClassicalApproach)).

However, suppose I provide you with extra information:
I tell you that event $B$ has already occurred, where $B$ is the event 'the number rolled is even'.

With this extra information, only three numbers could possibly have been rolled; the *reduced sample space* is
$$
   S^* = \{2, 4, 6 \}.
$$
All of these outcomes are equally likely.
However, the probability that the number is a six is now $\Pr(A\mid B) = 1/3$.

Knowing the extra information in event $B$ has changed the calculation of $\Pr(A)$.
:::


::: {.example #Planes name="Planes"}
Consider these two events:
\begin{align*}
   D:&\quad \text{A person dies};\\
   F:&\quad \text{A person falls from an airborne plane with no parachute}.
\end{align*}
Consider the probability $\Pr(D \mid F)$.
If you are told that someone falls out of an airborne plane with no parachute, the probability that they die is very high.

Then, consider the probability $\Pr(F\mid D)$.
If you are told that some has died, the cause is very unlikely to be a fall from an airborne plane.

Thus, the first probability is very close to one, and the second is very close to zero.
:::


Two methods exist for computing conditional probability: first principles, or a formal definition of $\Pr(A \mid B)$.
Using first principles, consider the original sample space $S$, remove the sample points inconsistent with the new information that $B$ has provided, form a new sample space, say $S^*$, and recompute the probability of event $A$ relative to $S^*$.
$S^*$ is called the *reduced sample space*.

This method is appropriate when the number of outcomes is relatively small.
The following formal definition applies more generally.


::: {.definition #ConditionalProb name="Conditional probability"}
Let $A$ and $B$ be events in $S$ with $\Pr(B) > 0$.
Then
$$
   \Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(A\cap B)}{\Pr(B)}.
$$
:::


The definition automatically takes care of the sample space reduction noted earlier.

::: {.example #RainfallDF name="Rainfall"}
Consider again the rainfall at Charleville in April (Example\ \@ref(exm:ChanceRain)).
Define $L$ as the event 'receiving *more than* $30$\ mm in April', and $R$ as the event 'receiving *any* rainfall in April'.
Event $L$ occurs `r L` times in the `r numYears` years of data, while event $R$ occurs `r R` times.

Using the relative frequency approach with the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au) data, the probability of obtaining *more than* $30$\ mm in April is:
$$
   \Pr(L) = \frac{`r L`}{`r Number`} = `r round(Prob30, 3)`. 
$$
However, the *conditional probability* of receiving more than $30$\ mm, *given* that some rainfall was recorded, is:
$$
   \Pr(L \mid  R) = \frac{\Pr(L \cap R)}{\Pr(R)} = \frac{\Pr(L)}{\Pr(R)} = \frac{`r round(Prob30, 4)`}{`r round(Prob0, 4)`} = `r round(CProb30, 3)`.  
$$
If we know rain has fallen, the probability that the amount was greater than $30$\ mm is `r round(CProb30, 3)`.
Without this prior knowledge, the probability is `r round(Prob30, 3)`.

:::{.example #MumpsIndependence name="Conditional probability"}

For males, the probability of complying with the isolation request is

### Multiplication rule {#MultiplicationRule}

A consequence of Def.\ \@ref(def:ConditionalProb) is the following theorem.


:::{.theorem #MultRule name="Multiplication rule for probabilities"}
For any events $A$ and $B$, the probability of $A$ and $B$ is
\begin{align*}
     \Pr(A\cap B)
     &= \Pr(A) \Pr(B \mid A)\\
     &= \Pr(B) \Pr(A \mid B).
\end{align*}
:::


This rule can be generalised to any number of events.
For example, for three events $A$, $B$, $C$,
$$
  \Pr(A\cap B\cap C) = \Pr(A)\Pr(B\mid A)\Pr(C\mid A\cap B).
$$


### Independent events {#Independence}

The important idea of *independence* can now be defined.


::: {.definition #Independence name="Independence"}
Two events $A$ and $B$ are *independent* if and only if
$$
  \Pr(A\cap B) = \Pr(A)\Pr(B).
$$
Otherwise the events *dependent* (or *not independent*).
:::


:::{.proof}
Exercise.
:::



Provided $\Pr(B) > 0$, Defs.\ \@ref(def:ConditionalProb) and\ \@ref(def:Independence) show that $A$ and $B$ are independent if, and only if, $\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A)$.
This statement of independence makes sense: $\Pr(A \mid B)$ is the probability of $A$ occurring if $B$ has already occurred, while $\Pr(A)$ is the probability that $A$ occurs without any knowledge of whether $B$ has occurred or not. 
If these are equal, then $B$ has occurring has made no difference to the probability that $A$ occurs, which is what *independence* means.



:::{.example}
In Example\ \@ref(exm:MumpsIndependence), the probability of males isolating was the *same* as the probability of females isolating.
The sex of the student is *independent* of whether they isolate.
That is, whether we look at females or males, the probability that they isolated is the same.
:::


The idea of independence can be generalised to more than two events.
For three events, the following definition of *mutual independence* applies, which naturally extends to any number of events.


::: {.definition #MutualIndependence name="Mutual independence"}
Three events $A$, $B$ and $C$ are *mutually independent* if, and only if,
\begin{align*}
     \Pr(A\cap B) & = \Pr(A)\Pr(B).\\
     \Pr(A\cap C) & = \Pr(A)\Pr(C).\\
     \Pr(B\cap C) & = \Pr(B)\Pr(C).\\
     \Pr(A\cap B\cap C) & = \Pr(A) \Pr(B) \Pr(C).
     \end{align*}
:::
Three events can be *pairwise* independent in the sense of Def.\ \@ref(def:Independence), but not be *mutually independent*.

The following theorem concerning independent events is sometimes useful.

:::{.theorem #IndependenceFeatures name="Independent events"}
If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then

* $A$ and $B^c$ are independent.
* $A^c$ and $B$ are independent.
* $A^c$ and $B^c$ are independent.
:::

:::{.proof}
Exercise.
:::


### Independence and mutually exclusive events {IndependentEvents]}

[Mutually exclusive](def:MutuallyExclusive) and [independent](def:Independence) events sometimes get confused.

The simple events defined by the outcomes in a sample space are mutually exclusive, since only one can occur in any realisation of the random process.
Mutually exclusive events have no common outcomes: for example, both passing and failing this course is not possible in the one semester.
Obtaining one excludes the possibility of the other... so *whether one occurs depends on whether the other has occurred*.

In contrast, if two events are *independent*, then whether or not one occurs does not affect the chance of the other happening.
If event $A$ can occur, then $B$ happening will not influence the chance of $A$ happening if they are independent, so *it does not exclude the possibility of the other occurring*.

Confusion between mutual exclusiveness and independence arises sometimes because the sample space is not clearly identified.

Consider a random process involving tossing two coins *at the same time*.
The sample space is
$$
   S_2 = \{(HH), (HT), (TH), (TT)\}
$$
and these outcomes are mutually exclusive, each with probability $1/4$ (using the classical approach).
For example, $\Pr\big( (HH) \big) = 1/4$.

An alternative view of this random process is to think of *repeating the process of tossing a coin once*.
For one toss of a coin, the sample space
$$
   S_1 = \{ H, T \}
$$
and $\Pr(H) = 1/2$ is the probability of getting a head on the *first* toss.
This is also the probability of getting a head on the *second* toss.

The events 'getting a head on the first toss' and 'getting a head on the second toss' are **not mutually exclusive**, because both events can occur together: the event $(HH)$ is an outcome in $S_2$.
Whether or not the outcomes $(HH)$ occurred *simultaneously*, because the two coins were tossed at the one time, or *sequentially*, in that one coin was tossed twice, is irrelevant.

Our interest is in the *joint* outcomes from two tosses.
The event 'getting a head on the "first" toss' is:
$$
   E_1 = \{ (HH), (HT) \}
$$
and 'getting a head on the "second" toss' is
$$
   E_2 = \{ (HH), (TH) \},
$$
where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are events defined on $S_2$.
This makes it clear that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are not mutually exclusive because $E_1\cap E_2 \ne \varnothing$.

The two events $E_1$ and $E_2$ are *independent* because,  whether or not a head occurs on one of the tosses, the probability of a head occurring on the other is still $1/2$.
Seeing that the events are independent provides another way of calculating the probability of the two heads occurring 'together': $1/2\times 1/2 = 1/4$, since the probabilities of *independent* events can be multiplied


::: {.example #Mendell name="Mendell's peas"}
@BIB:Mendel:hybrids conducted famous experiments in genetics.
In one study, Mendel crossed a pure line of round yellow peas with a pure line of wrinkled green peas.
Table\ \@ref(tab:PeaTable) shows what happened in the *second* generation.
For example, $\Pr(\text{round peas}) = 0.7608$.
Biologically, about $75$% of peas are expected to be round; the data appear reasonably sound in this respect.\smallskip

Is the type of pea (rounded or wrinkled) *independent* of the colour?
That is, if the pea is rounded, does it impact the colour of the pea?\smallskip

Independence can be evaluated using the formula is $\Pr(\text{round} \mid \text{yellow}) = \Pr(\text{round})$.
In other words, the fact that the pea is yellow does not affect that probability that the pea is rounded.
From Table\ \@ref(tab:PeaTable):
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(\text{rounded}) 
   &= 0.5665 + 0.1942 = 0.7608,\\
   \Pr(\text{round} \mid \text{yellow}) 
   &= 0.5665/(0.5665 + 0.1817) = 0.757.
\end{align*}

These two probabilities are very close.
The data in the table are just a *sample* (from the population of all peas), so assuming the colour and shape of the peas are independent is reasonable.

### Partitioning the sample space {#SSPartitions}

The concepts introduced in this section allow us to determine the probability of an event using the *event-decomposition approach*, which we now discuss.


::: {.definition #Partitioning name="Partitioning"}
The events $B_1, B_2, \ldots , B_k$ are said to represent a *partition* of the sample space $S$ if

1. They are *mutually exclusive*: $B_i \cap B_j = \varnothing$ for all $i \neq j$.
2. The events are *exhaustive*: $B_1 \cup B_2 \cup \ldots \cup B_k = S$.
3. The events have a non-zero probability of occurring: $\Pr(B_i) > 0$ for all $i$.
:::


The implication is that when the random process is performed, one and only one of the events $B_i$ ($i = 1, \ldots, k)$ occurs.
We use this concept in the following theorem.


:::{.theorem #TotalProb name="Theorem of total probability"}
Let $A$ be an event in $S$ and $\{B_1, B_2, \ldots , B_k\}$ a partition of $S$.
Then
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(A) 
   &= \Pr(A \mid B_1) \Pr(B_1) + \Pr(A \mid B_2)\Pr(B_2) + \ldots \\
   & \qquad {} + \Pr(A \mid B_k)\Pr(B_k).
\end{align*}
:::

:::{.proof}
The proof follows from writing $A = (A\cap B_1) \cup (A\cap B_2) \cup \ldots \cup (A\cap B_k)$, where the events on the RHS are mutually exclusive.
The [third axiom](#def:ThreeAxioms) of probability together with the multiplication rule yield the result.
:::


:::{.example #TheroemTotalprob name="Theorem of total probability"}
Consider event $A$: 'rolling an even number on a die', and also define the events
$$
   B_i:\quad\text{The number $i$ is rolled on a die}
$$
where $i = 1, 2, \dots 6$.
The events $B_i$ represent a [*partition*](#def:Partitioning) of the sample space.

Then, using the *Theorem of total probability* (Sect.\ \@ref(thm:TotalProb)):  
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(A)
   &= \Pr(A \mid B_1)\times \Pr(B_1)\quad +  \quad\Pr(A \mid B_2)\times \Pr(B_2) \quad+ {}\\

   &\quad \left(0\times \frac{1}{6}\right) + \left(1\times \frac{1}{6}\right) + {}\\
   &\quad \left(0\times \frac{1}{6}\right) + \left(1\times \frac{1}{6}\right) 
    = \frac{1}{2}.

This the same answer obtained using the classical approach.

### Bayes' theorem {#BayesTheorem}

If an event is known to have occurred (i.e., non-zero probability), and the sample space is partitioned, a result known as *Bayes' theorem* enables us to determine the probabilities associated with each of the partitioned events.


:::{.theorem #Bayes name="Bayes' theorem"}
Let $A$ be an event in $S$ such that $\Pr(A) > 0$, and $\{ B_1, B_2, \ldots , B_k\}$ is a [partition](#def:Partitioning) of $S$.
Then
$$
   \Pr(B_i \mid A) = \frac{\Pr(B_i) \Pr(A \mid B_i)}
                          {\displaystyle \sum_{j = 1}^k \Pr(B_j)\Pr(A \mid B_j)}
$$
for $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$.
:::

:::{.proof}
This is a direct application of Def.\ \@ref(def:ConditionalProb), the multiplication rule and Theorem\ \@ref(thm:TotalProb).
:::

Notice that the right-side includes conditional probabilities of the form $\Pr(A\mid B_i)$, while the left-side contains the probability $\Pr(B_i\mid A)$.
In effect, the theorem takes a conditional probability and can 'reverse' the conditioning.

Bayes' theorem has many uses, as it uses conditional probabilities that are easy to find or estimate to compute a conditional probability that is *not* easy to find or estimate.
The theorem is the basis of a branch of statistics known as *Bayesian statistics* which involves using pre-existing evidence in drawing conclusions from data.


::: {.example #BreastCancer name="Breast cancer"}
The success of mammograms for detecting breast cancer has been well documented [@white1993mammography]. 
Mammograms are generally conducted on women over $40$, though breast cancer rarely occurs in women under $40$.\smallskip

We can define two events of interest:
\begin{align*}
   C:&\quad \text{The woman has breast cancer; and}\\
   D:&\quad \text{The mammogram returns a positive test result.}
\end{align*}
As with any diagnostic tool, a mammogram is not perfect.
*Sensitivity* and *specificity* are used to describe the accuracy of a test:

* *Sensitivity* is the probability of a *true* positive test result: the probability of a positive test result for people *with* the disease.
  This is $\Pr(D \mid C)$.
* *Specificity* is the probability of a *true* negative test result: the probability of a negative test for people *without* the disease.
  This is $\Pr(D^c \mid C^c)$.

Clearly, we would like both these probabilities to be a high as possible.
For mammograms [@houssami2003sydney], the *sensitivity* is estimated as about $0.75$ and the *specificity* as about $0.90$.
We can write:

* $\Pr(D \mid C ) = 0.75$ (and so $\Pr(D^c \mid C) = 0.25$);
* $\Pr(D^c \mid C^c) = 0.90$ (and so $\Pr(D \mid C^c) = 0.10$).

Furthermore, about 2% of women under 40 will get breast cancer [@houssami2003sydney]; that is, $\Pr(C) = 0.02$ (and hence $\Pr(C^c) = 0.98$).\smallskip

For this study, the probabilities $\Pr(D\mid C)$ are easy to find: women who are *known* to have breast cancer have a mammogram, and we record whether the result is positive or negative.\smallskip

But consider a woman under $40$ who gets a mammogram.
When the results are returned, her interest is whether they have breast cancer, *given* the test results; for example $\Pr(C \mid D)$.
In other words: If the test returns a positive result, what is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?\smallskip

That is, we would like to take probabilities like $\Pr(D\mid C)$, that can be found readily, and determine $\Pr(C \mid  D)$, which is of interest in practice.
Using [Bayes' Theorem](#thm:Bayes):
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(C \mid D) 
   &= \frac{\Pr(C) \times \Pr(D \mid  C)}
            {\Pr(C)\times \Pr(D \mid  C) + \Pr(C^c)\times \Pr(D \mid  C^c) }\\
   &= \frac{0.02 \times 0.75}
            {(0.02\times 0.75) + (0.98\times 0.10)}\\
   &= \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.098} =  0.1327.         
\end{align*}
Consider what this says: Given that a mammogram returns a *positive test* (for a woman under $40$), the probability that the woman really has breast cancer is only about $6$%...
This partly explains why mammograms for women under $40$ are not commonplace: most women who return a positive test result actually do not have breast cancer.\smallskip

The reason for this surprising result is explained in Example\ \@ref(exm:BreastCancerTree).

## Computing probabilities {#ComputingProbs}

Different schemes can be used to help compute probabilities, such as tree diagrams, tables, Venn diagrams and counting.
Typically, multiple methods may be applied to a given situation, but one method is often easier to apply.


### Tree diagrams {#TreeDiagrams}

Tree diagrams are useful when a [random process](#def:RandomProcess) can be seen, or thought of, as occurring in steps or stages.
The branches in the 'second stage' are *conditional probabilities*, conditional on the branch of the first step. 
Of course, the ideas extend to multiple steps.


:::{.example #BreastCancerTree name="Breast cancer"}
Consider using a tree diagram to describe the breast cancer information from Example\ \@ref(exm:BreastCancer) (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BreastTree)).
By following each 'branch' of the tree, we can compute, for example:
$$
   \Pr(C \cap D) = \Pr(C)\times \Pr(D\mid C) = 0.02 \times 0.75 = 0.015;
$$
that is, the probability that a woman has a positive test **and** breast cancer is about $0.015$.
But compare:
$$
   \Pr(C^c \cap D) = \Pr(C^c)\times \Pr(D\mid C^c) = 0.98 \times 0.10 = 0.098;
$$
that is, the probability that a woman has a positive test **and no** breast cancer (that is, a *false* positive) is about $0.098$.\smallskip

This explains the surprisingly result in Example\ \@ref(exm:BreastCancer): because breast cancer is so uncommon in younger women, the *false* positives ($0.098$) overwhelm the *true* positives ($0.015$).

### Tables {#Tables}

With two variables of interest, tables may be a convenient way of summarizing the information.
Although tables can be used to represent random processes using conditional probabilities, usually tables are used to represent the whole sample space.


:::{.example #BreastCancer2 name="Breast cancer"}
The breast-cancer data in Example\ \@ref(exm:BreastCancer) can also be compiled into a table giving the four outcomes in the sample space (Table\ \@ref(tab:BreastTable)).
:::

```{r BreastTable, echo=FALSE}
BreastTable <- array(dim = c(2, 3))

colnames(BreastTable) <- c("+ive test",
                           "-ive test",
                           "Total")
rownames(BreastTable) <- c("Has breast cancer",
                           "Does not have breast cancer")
BreastTable[1, ] <- c("$0.75 \\times 0.02 = 0.015$",
                      "$0.25 \\times 0.02 = 0.005$",
                      "0.02")
BreastTable[2, ] <- c("$0.10 \\times 0.98 = 0.098$",
                      "$0.90 \\times 0.98 = 0.882$",
                      0.98)

if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  knitr::kable(BreastTable,
               format = "latex",
               booktabs = TRUE,
               align = "r",
               longtable = FALSE,                
               escape = FALSE,
               caption = "The probabilities from the breast cancer example") %>%
    kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)

    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) 
}
```




### Venn diagrams {#VennDiagrams}

Venn diagrams can be useful when there are two events, sometimes three, but become unworkable for more than three.
Often, tables can be used to better represent situations shown in Venn diagrams.




::: {.example #BreastCancerVenn name="Breast cancer"}
Consider again the breast cancer data (Example\ \@ref(exm:BreastCancer), where the events $C$ and $D$ were defined [earlier](#exm:BreastCancer)).
A Venn diagram could be constructed to show the sample space (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BreastVenn)).

### Counting sample spaces {#Counting}

Sometimes the most convenient way to compute probabilities is to list the sample space.
This only works for sample spaces with a small number of discrete elements, and works best when each of the outcomes in the sample space are equally likely.


::: {.example #TwoDice name="Rolling two dice"}
Consider rolling two standard dice and noting the *sum* of the numbers shown.
The sample space is listed in Table\ \@ref(tab:TwoDice).
Then, for example, $\Pr(\text{sum is 7}) = 6/36$ is found by counting the equally-likely outcomes that sum to seven.
:::

```{r TwoDice, echo=FALSE}
Die1 <- 1:6
Die2 <- 1:6

DieSum <- outer(Die1, Die2,
                FUN = "+")

rownames(DieSum) <- paste("Die 1:", 1:6)
colnames(DieSum) <- paste("Die 2:", 1:6)


if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  knitr::kable(DieSum,
               format = "latex",
               booktabs = TRUE,
               align = "r",
               longtable = FALSE,
               linesep = c("", "", "\\addlinespace"),
               escape = FALSE,
               caption = "The sum of rolling two dice") %>%
    kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
}
if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
  knitr::kable(DieSum,
               escape = TRUE,
               format = "html",
               booktabs = TRUE,
               align = "r",
               longtable = FALSE,                
               caption = "The sum of rolling two dice") %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
}
```

The number of elements in a set is often large, and a complete enumeration of the set is unnecessary if all we want to do is to count the number of elements in the set.
When the number of elements in the sample space is large, principles and formulae exist which aid counting, some of which are described in the following sections.



### Multiplication principle {#MultiplicationPrinciple}

If we have $m$ ways to perform act $A$ and if, for *each* of these, there are $n$ ways to perform act $B$, then there are $m\times n$ ways to perform the acts $A$ *and* $B$. 
This is called the *multiplication principle*.


:::{.definition #MultiplicationPrinciple name="Multiplication principle"}
With $m$ elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m$ and $n$ elements $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ then $mn$ pairs can be made containing one element from each group.
:::


The principle can be extended to any number of sets.
For example: For three sets of elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m$, $b_1, b_2, \ldots , b_n$ and $c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_p$, the number of distinct triplets containing one element from each set is $mnp$.


:::{.example #MultiplicationPrinciple name="Multiplication principle"}
Suppose a restaurants offers five main courses and three desserts.
If a 'meal' consists of one main plus one dessert, then $5\times 3 = 15$ meal combinations are possible.
:::


### Permutations {#Permutations}

Another important counting problem deals with different permutations of a finite set.
The word *permutation* in this context means an *ordering* of the set: selecting elements when the *selection order is important*.


#### Selecting without replacement {#PermutationSelectWithoutReplacement}

Suppose a set has $n$ elements. 
To order these, the first element of the ordering must initially be chosen, which can be done in $n$ different ways.
The second element must then be chosen, which can be done in $(n - 1)$ ways (since it cannot be the same as the first).
There are then $(n - 2)$ ways for the third, and so on. 

We find (using the multiplication principle) that there are $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\ldots 2 \times 1$ different ways to order the $n$ elements. 
This is denoted by $n!$ and called '$n$-factorial':
$$
   n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \ldots (2)(1)
$$
where $n\geq 1$, and we define $0! = 1$.

In some cases, the number of ways in which only the first $r$ elements of an ordering may be chosen is needed. 

For this problem, the first element in the ordering may be chosen in $n$ different ways, the second in $(n - 1)$ ways, the third in $(n - 2)$ ways, and so on... down to the $rth$, which may be chosen in $(n - r + 1)$ ways. 

This number is denoted by $^nP_r$, and we write  
\begin{equation}
   ^nP_r = n(n - 1)(n - 2)\ldots (n - r + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}.
    (\#eq:Permutation)
\end{equation}
This expression is referred to as *the number of permutations of $r$ elements from a set with $n$ elements*.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Notation for permutations varies.
Other notation for permutations include $nPr$, $^nP_r$, $P_n^r$ or $P(n,r)$.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
By definition, $0! = 1$.
With this definition, many formulas (some follow) remain valid for all valid choices of $n$ and $r$.
:::


:::{.example #PasswordLowerCase name="Permutations"}
Suppose a company requires users to select a password of eight characters using only lower-case letters.
Since the order of the letters is important in a password, we work with *permutations*.
There are
$$
   \displaystyle {}^{26}P_8 =  \frac{26!}{(26 - 8)!} = 62\,990\,928\,000
$$
possible passwords to select.

#### Selecting with replacement {#PermutationSelectWithReplacement}

If each item can be re-selected (for example, the item is returned to the larger pool of items), we say that selection is done *with replacement*.

The number of *ordered selections* of $r$ objects chosen from $n$ *with replacement* is $n^r$.
The first object can be selected in $n$ ways, the second can be selected in $n$ ways, etc., and by the multiplication principle, we have $n^r$ possible outcomes.


### Combinations {#Combinations}

In some cases, order is not important when choosing a subset (i.e., when dealing a hand of cards). 
A *combination* of $r$ elements from a set $S$ is a subset of $S$ with exactly $r$ elements.


#### Selecting without replacement {#CombinationSelectWithoutReplacement}

The number of *combinations* of $r$ elements from a set with $n$ distinct elements is denoted by $^nC_r$.
The number of permutations is given by Eq.\ \@ref(eq:Permutation), but the number of combinations must be smaller, since many permutations are equivalent to the same combination.
In fact, each combination of $r$ elements can be ordered in $r!$ different ways, and so gives rise to $r!$ permutations.
Hence, the number of permutations must be $r!$ times the number of combinations.
We have then,
$$
   ^nC_r = \frac{n(n - 1)\ldots (n - r + 1)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!\,r!} = \frac{^n P_r}{r!}.
$$


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Notation for combinations varies.
Other notation for combinations include $nCr$, $^nC_r$, $C_n^r$, $\binom{n}{r}$ or $C(n,r)$.
:::



::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The difference between *permutations* and *combinations* is important!
With permutations, the *selection order* is important, whereas *selection order is not important* with combinations.
In addition, both formulae apply when *there is no replacement* of the items.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
This may help you remember when to use permutations and combinations

* **P**ermutations are used for **p**asswords.
* **C**ombinations are used when dealing **c**ards.
:::





::: {.example #ChooseDigits name="Selecting digits"}
Consider the set of integers ${1, 3, 5, 7}$.
Choose two numbers, *without replacement*; call the first $a$ and the second $b$.
If we then compute $a\times b$, then $^4C_2 = 6$ answers are possible since the *selection order is not important* (e.g., $3 \times 7$ gives the *same* answer as $7 \times 3$).\smallskip

However, if we compute $a\div b$, then $^4P_2 = 12$ answers are possible, since the *selection order is important* (e.g., $3 \div 7$ gives a *different* answer than $7 \div 3$).
:::


:::{.example #CombinationOzLotto name="Oz Lotto combinations"}
In [Oz Lotto](#exm:Lotto), players select seven numbers from 47, and try to match these with seven randomly selected numbers.
The order in which the seven numbers are selected in not important, so *combinations* (not permutations) are appropriate.
That is, winning numbers drawn in the order, as $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ are effectively the same as if they were drawn in the order $\{7, 2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5\}$.\smallskip

The number of options for players to choose from is
$$
   \binom{47}{7} = \frac{47!}{40!\times 7!} = 62\,891\,499;
$$
that is, almost $63$\ million combinations are possible.\smallskip

The probability of picking the correct seven numbers in a single guess is therefore
$$
   \frac{1}{62\,891\,499} = 1.59\times 10^{-8} = 0.000\,000\,015\,9.
$$

The binomial expansion
$$
  (a + b)^n = \sum^{n}_{r = 0} \binom{n}{r} a^r b^{n - r}
$$
for $n$ a positive integer, is often referred to as the *Binomial Theorem* and hence $\binom{n}{r}$ is referred to as a *binomial coefficient*.
This series, and associated properties, is sometimes useful in counting.
Some of the properties of combinations are stated below.

1. $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n - r}$, for $r = 0, 1, \ldots, n$.
2. As a special case of the above, $\binom{n}{0} = 1 = \binom{n}{n}$.
3. $\sum_{r = 0}^n \binom{n}{r} = 2^n$.



#### Selecting without replacement {#CombinationSelectWithReplacement}

The number of ways $r$ objects can be chosen from $n$ *with replacement* and *without regard to order* is somewhat more difficult and won't be attempted here.
The number of ways is actually $\binom{n + r - 1}{r}$.



## Introducing statistical computing {#StatisticalComputing}



### COINS TOSS SIMULATION

**THIS IS CIRCULAR: Assume p = 0.5 to show p = 0.,5**

::: {.example #CoinToss name="Simulating a coin toss"}
Repeating random processes large numbers of times can be impractical and tedious.
However, sometimes a computer can be used to *simulate* the random processes.
Consider using a computer to simulate large numbers of coin tosses; here, **R** is used to simulate 500 tosses.

Use $\Pr(\text{Toss head}) = 0.5$.
Then, after each toss, the probability of obtaining a head using all the available information was computed after each toss.
For one such simulation, these running probabilities are shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SimTosses).
While the result of any single toss is unpredictable, we see the general pattern emerging: Heads occur about half the time.

CHECK: THIS IS THE (weak? strog?) LAW of large numbers or something???????
:::

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(966141)                     # For repeatability
```

```{r SimTossesA, echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
NumTosses <- 500 # Simulated tossing a coin 500 times
Tosses <- sample(x = c("H", "T"),    # Choose "H"  or  "T"
                 size = NumTosses,   # Do this 500 times
                 replace = TRUE)     # H and T can be reselected 
Tosses[1 : 10]                       # Show the first 10 results
```

Now plot the running probabilities:

```{r SimTosses, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "A simulation of tossing a fair coin $500$ times. The probability of getting a head is computed from the data after each toss.", fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5, out.width='65%'}
TossNumber <- 1:NumTosses            # Sequence: from 1 to 500
PropHeads <- cumsum(Tosses == "H") / TossNumber
                                     # P(Heads) after each toss

plot(PropHeads,
     main = "The proportion of heads after a given number of tosses",
     xlab = "Toss number",          # Label on x-axis
     ylab = "Proportion of heads",  # Label on y-axis
     type = "l",       # Draw a "l"ine rather than "p"oints
     lwd = 2,          # Make line of width '2'
     ylim = c(0, 1),   # y-axis limits
     las = 1,          # Make axes labels horizontal
     col = "blue")     # Line colour: blue
abline( h = 0.5,       # Draw horizontal line at y = 0.5
        col = "grey")  # Make line grey in colour
```


Using the empirical approach shows why probabilities are between 0 and 1 (inclusive), since the proportions $m/n$ are always between 0 and 1 (inclusive).





### Example: the gameshow (Monty Hall) problem {#Gameshow}

A game show contestant is told there is a car behind one of three doors, and a goat behind each of the other doors. 
The contestant is asked to select a door. 

The host of the show (who knows where the car is) now opens one of the doors *not* selected by the contestant, and reveals a goat. 
The host now gives the contestant the choice of either (a)\ retaining the door chosen first, or (b)\ switching and choosing the other (unopened) door. 
Which of the following is the contestant's best strategy?

1. Always retain the first choice.
2. Always change and select the other door.
3. Choose either unopened door at random.



::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
What strategy do you think would be best?
:::


Only a brief outline of the method is given here. 
A more complete solution is given later.

1. Generate a random sequence of length $1000$ of the digits $1$, $2$ and $3$ to represent which door is hiding the car on each of $1000$ nights. 
2. Generate another such sequence to represent the contestants *first* choice on each of the $1000$ nights (assumed chosen at random).
3. The number of times the numbers in the two lists of random numbers *do* agree represents the number of times the contestant will win *if the contestant doesn't change doors*.
   If the numbers in the two columns *don't* agree then the contestant will win *only if the contestant decides to change doors*.

For the $1000$ nights simulated, contestants would have won the car $303$ times if they retained their first choice which means they would have won $697$ times if they had changed. 
(Does this agree with your intuition?) 
This implies (correctly!) that the best strategy is to change. 
You might like to try doing the simulation for yourself.

The correct theoretical probability of winning if you retain the original door is $1/3$, but $2/3$ if you change.) 
We obtained a reasonable estimate of these probabilities from the simulation: $303/1000$ and $697/1000$. 
These estimates would improve for larger simulation sizes.

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(93671)          # For reproducibility

NumSims <- 1000          # The number of simulations
# Choose the door where the car is hiding:
CarDoor <- sample(1:3,  # Could be behind Door 1, 2 or 3
                  size = NumSims, # Repeat
                  replace = TRUE)
# Choose the contestants initial choice:
FirstChoice <- sample(1:3,        # Could guess Door 1, 2 or 3
                  size = NumSims, # Repeat
                  replace = TRUE)

# Compute the chances of winning the car:
WinByNotSwitching  <- sum( CarDoor == FirstChoice)
WinBySwitching     <- sum( CarDoor != FirstChoice)

c(WinByNotSwitching, WinBySwitching) / NumSims
```

:::{.exercise #RandomisedResponse}
To get honest answers to sensitive questions, sometimes the *randomised response technique* is used.
For example, suppose the aim is to discover the proportion of students who have used illegal drugs in the past twelve months. 

$N$ cards are prepared, where $m$ have the statement 'I *have* used an illegal drug in the past twelve months'.
The remaining $N - m$ cards have the statement 'I *have not* used an illegal drug in the past twelve months'.

Each student in the sample then selects one card at random from the prepared pile of $N$ cards, and answers 'True' or 'False' when asked the question 'Is the statement on the selected card true or false?' without divulging which statement is on the card. 
Since the interviewer does not know which card has been presented, the interviewer does not know if the person has used drugs or not from this answer.

Let $T$ be the probability that a student answers 'True', and $p$ be the probability that a student chosen at random has used an illegal drug.
Assume that each student answers the question on the chosen card truthfully.

$$

  1 - \left(\frac{365}{365}\right) \times \left(\frac{364}{365}\right) \times \left(\frac{363}{365}\right) \times \dots\times \left(\frac{365 - n + 1}{365}\right).
$$
2. Graph the relationship for various values of $N$, using the above form to compute the probability.
3. What assumptions are necessary? 
   Are these reasonable?

:::{.exercise #SixNumbersConsecutive}
Six numbers are randomly selected *without replacement* from the numbers $1, 2, 3,\dots, 45$.
Model this process using **R** to estimate the probability that there are *no consecutive numbers* amongst the numbers selected.
(That is, no sequence like `4, 5` or `33, 34` or `21, 22, 23` appears, once the numbers are sorted smallest to largest.)

:::{.exercise #TwoEventsOverline}
Suppose the events $A$ and $B$ have probabilities $\Pr(A) = 0.4$ and $\Pr(B) = 0.3$, and $\Pr(A\cup B) = 0.5$.
Determine $\Pr( A^c \cap B^c)$.
Are $A$ and $B$ independent events?
:::


:::{.exercise #TwoEventsAbsorption}
For sets $A$ and $B$, show that:

1. $A\cup (A\cap B) = A$;
2. $A\cap (A\cup B) = A$.

These are called the *absorption laws*.

A new cars can be purchased with options:

* Seven different paints colours are available;
* Three different trim levels are available;
* Cars can be purchased with or without a sunroof.

How many possible combinations are possible?

:::{.exercise #PairsPoker}
In some forms of poker, five cards are dealt to each player, and certain combinations then beat other combinations.

1. What is the probability that the initial five cards include *exactly* one pair.
   (This implies *not* getting a three of a kind or four of a kind.)
   Explain your reasoning.
2. What is the probability that the initial five cards includes *only* picture cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack)?

1. If $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are independent events, prove that
$$
   \Pr(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n) = 1 - [1 - \Pr(A_1)][1 - \Pr(A_2)] \dots [1 - \Pr(A_n)].
