## Expected values {#ExpectedValue}

Because random variables are *random*, knowing the outcome on any one realisation of the random process is not possible.
Instead, we can talk about what we might *expect* to happen, or what might happen *on average*.

This is the idea of *mathematical expectation*. 
In more usual terms, the mathematical expression of the probability distribution of a random variable is the *mean* of the random variable.
Mathematical expectation goes far beyond just computing means, but we begin here as the idea of a *mean* is easily understood.

The definition looks different in detail for discrete, continuous and mixed random variables, but the intention is the same.


:::{.definition #Expectation name="Expectation"}
The *expectation* or *expected value* (or *mean*) of a random variable\ $X$ is written $\operatorname{E}[X]$ (or $\mu$, or $\mu_X$ to distinguish between random variables).

For a *discrete* random variable\ $X$ with pmf $p_X(x)$, the expected value is
$$
   \operatorname{E}[X] = 
        \sum_{x\in \mathcal{R}_X} x\, p_X(x).
$$
For a *continuous* random variable\ $X$ with pdf $f_X(x)$, the expected value is
$$
   \operatorname{E}[X] = 
        \int_{-\infty}^\infty x\, f_X(x).
$$
:::

For a *mixed* random variable\ $X$, the expected value is a combination of the two above results, for the discrete and continuous components of\ $\mathcal{R}_X$; that is,
$$
   \operatorname{E}[X] = 
     \sum_{x_i} x_i \, p_X(x_i) + \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, f_X(x) \, dx,
$$
where $p_X(x)$ is the probability mass function over discrete points\ $x_i\in \mathcal{R}_X$, and $f_X(x)$ is the probability density function (pdf) over the continuous regions of $x\in \mathcal{R}_X$ with pdf $f_X(x)$.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
In the rest of this chapter, the case of mixed random variable\ $X$ will not be explicitly discussed; however, the results remain a combination of the discrete case for the discrete points in\ $\mathcal{R}_X$ and the continuous case for the continuous component of\ $\mathcal{R}_X$.
:::


Effectively $\operatorname{E}[X]$ is a weighted average of the points in\ $\mathcal{R}_X$, the weights being the probabilities for each value of $x\in \mathcal{R}_X$ in the discrete case and probability densities in the continuous case.


:::{.example #ExpectationDiscrete name="Expectation for discrete variables"}
Consider the discrete random variable\ $U$ with probability function
$$
   p_U(u) = \begin{cases}
               (u^2 + 1)/5 & \text{for $u = -1, 0, 1$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere},
           \end{cases}
$$
so that $\mathcal{R}_U = \{-1, 0, 1\}$.
The expected value of\ $U$ is
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[U]
   &= \sum_{\mathcal{R}_U} u\, p_U(u) \\
   &= \sum_{\mathcal{R}_U} u \times\left( \frac{u^2 + 1}{5} \right) \\
   &= \left( -1 \times \frac{(-1)^2 + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 0 \times \frac{(0)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 1 \times \frac{(1)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) \\
   &= -2/5 + 0 + 2/5 = 0.
\end{align*}
The expected value of\ $U$ is\ $\operatorname{E}[U] = 0$.
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationContinuousX name="Expectation for continuous variables"}
Consider a continuous random variable\ $X$ with pdf
$$
   f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
               x/4 & \text{for $1 < x < 3$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere}.
            \end{cases}
$$
The expected value of\ $X$ is
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[X]
   &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty x\, f_X(x) \, dx
    = \int_1^3 x(x/4)\, dx\\
   &= \left.\frac{1}{12} x^3\right|_1^3 = 13/6.
\end{align*}
The expected value of\ $X$ is $\operatorname{E}[X] = 13/6$.

:::{.example #ExpectationMixedX name="Expectation for mixed variables"}
Consider a continuous random variable\ $W$ with probability function
$$
  f_W(w) = 
  \begin{cases}
     1/2       & \text{for $w = 0$};\\
     \exp(-2w) & \text{for $w > 0$};\\
     0         & \text{elsewhere},
  \end{cases}
$$
so that $p_W(w) = 1/2$ for $w = 0$, and $f_W(w) = \exp(-2w)$ for $w > 0$.
The expected value of\ $W$ is 
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[W]
   &= \overbrace{\sum_{w = 0} w\, p_W(w)}^{\text{Discrete component}} \quad + \quad \overbrace{\int_{-\infty}^\infty w\, f_W(w)\, dw}^{\text{Continuous component}}\\
   &= \sum_{w = 0} 0\times (1/2)\quad + \quad \int_{0}^\infty w\times \exp(-2w)\, dw\\
   &= 0 \quad + \quad 1/4\\
   &= 1/4.
\end{align*}
The expected value of\ $W$ is $\operatorname{E}[W] = 1/4$.
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationCoinOnce name="Expectation for a coin toss"}
Consider tossing a coin *once* and counting the number of tails.
Let this random variable be\ $T$.
The probability function is
$$
   p_T(t) = \begin{cases}
               0.5 & \text{for $t = 0$ or $t = 1$};\\
               0   & \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
$$
The expected value of\ $T$ is
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[T]
   &= \sum_{i = 1}^2 t\, p_T(t)\\
   &= \Pr(T = 0) \times 0 \quad + \quad \Pr(T = 1) \times 1\\
   &= (0.5 \times 0) \qquad + \qquad (0.5 \times 1) = 0.5.
\end{align*}
Of course, $0.5$\ tails can never actually be observed in practice on one toss.
But it would be silly to round up (or down) and say that the expected number of tails on one toss of a coin is one (or zero).
The expected value of\ $0.5$ simply means that over a large number of repetitions of this random process, a tail is *expected* to occur in half of those repetitions.

:::{.example #InfiniteMean name="Mean not defined"}
Consider the distribution of\ $Z$, with the probability density function

as in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:NoMean).
The expected value of\ $Z$ is

However, $\displaystyle\lim_{z\to\infty}\, -\log z \to \infty$.

## Expectation of a function of a random variable {#ExpectationFunction}

\index{Expected value|(}
While the mean can be expressed in terms of mathematical expectation, mathematical expectation is a more general concept.

Let\ $X$ be a discrete random variable with a probability function $p_X(x)$, or a continuous random variable with pdf $f_X(x)$.
Also assume $g(X)$ is a real-valued function of\ $X$.
We can then define the expected value of $g(X)$.


:::{.definition #ExpectationFunction name="Expectation for function of a random variable"}
The *expected value* of some function $g(\cdot)$ of a random variable\ $X$ is written $\operatorname{E}[ g(X)]$.

For a *discrete* random variable\ $X$ wth pmf $p_X(x)$, the expected value of $g(X)$ is
$$
   \operatorname{E}\big[g(X)\big)] = \sum_{x\in \mathcal{R}_X} g(x)\, p_X(x).
$$
For a *continuous* random variable\ $X$ wth pdf $f_X(x)$, the expected value of $g(X)$ is
$$
   \operatorname{E}\big[g(X)\big] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)\, f_X(x)\,dx.
$$
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationDiscreteFnX name="Expectation for a function of a discrete variable"}
Consider the discrete random variable\ $U$ with probability function shown in Example\ \@ref(exm:ExpectationDiscrete):
$$
   p_U(u) = \begin{cases}
               (u^2 + 1)/5 & \text{for $u = -1, 0, 1$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere}.
           \end{cases}
$$
Since $\mathcal{R}_U = \{-1, 0, 1\}$, then $\mathcal{R}_V = \{ (-1)^2, 0^2, 1^2\} = \{0, 1\}$.
Then expected value of $V = U^2$, where $g(U) = U^2$, is
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[V] = \operatorname{E}[g(U)]
   &= \sum_{\mathcal{R}_U} g(u)\, p_U(u) \\
   &= \left( (-1)^2 \times \frac{(-1)^2 + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 0^2 \times \frac{(0)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 1^2 \times \frac{(1)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) \\
   &= 2/5 + 0 + 2/5 = 4/5.
\end{align*}
The expected value of $V = U^2$ is\ $\operatorname{E}[V] = 4/5$.
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationContinuousXFnX name="Expectation for a function of a continuous variable"}
Consider the continuous random variable\ $X$ with probability density function shown in Example\ \@ref(exm:ExpectationContinuousX):
$$
   f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
               x/4 & \text{for $1 < x < 3$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere}.
            \end{cases}
$$
The expected value of $Y = \sqrt{X}$, where $g(X) = \sqrt{X}$, is
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[Y] = \operatorname{E}[ g(X) ]
   &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)\, f_X(x) \, dx\\
   &= \int_1^3 \sqrt{x}\times \frac{x}{4}\, dx\\
   &= \frac{9\sqrt{3} - 1}{10}\approx 1.458...
\end{align*}
The expected value of $Y = \sqrt{X}$ is $\operatorname{E}[Y] = (9\sqrt{3} - 1)/10$.
:::


Importantly, the expectation operator is a *linear operator*, as stated below.


:::{.theorem #ExpectationLinear name="Expectation properties"}
For any random variable\ $X$ and constants\ $a$ and\ $b$,
$$
   \operatorname{E}[aX + b] = a\operatorname{E}[X] + b.
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Assume\ $X$ is a discrete random variable with probability function $p_X(x)$.
By Def.\ \@ref(def:ExpectationFunction) with $g(X) = aX + b$,
$$
   \operatorname{E}[aX + b] = \sum_x (ax + b)\, p_X(x) = a\sum_x p_X(x) + \sum_x b\, p_X(x) = a\operatorname{E}[X] + b,
$$
using that $\sum_x p_X(x) = 1$.
(The proof in the continuous case is similar, but the probability function is a pdf and integrals replace summations.)

:::{.example #ExpectationFunctionY name="Expectation of a function of a random variable"}
Consider the random variable $Z = 2X$ where\ $X$ is defined in Example\ \@ref(exm:ExpectationContinuousX).
Using Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpectationLinear) with $a = 2$ and $b = 0$, the value of $\operatorname{E}[Z]$ is
$$
      \operatorname{E}[Z] = \operatorname{E}[2X] = 2\operatorname{E}[X] = 2 \times 13/6 = 13/3.

## The variance and standard deviation {#VarianceStdDev}

\index{Variance|(}
Apart from the mean, the most important description of a random variable is the *variability*: quantifying how the values of the random variable are dispersed.
The most important measure of variability is the *variance*.

The *variance* of a random variable is a measure of the variability of a random variable.
(More correct is to say 'the variance of the *distribution* of the random variable' rather than 'variance of a random variable', but this language is commonly used.)
A small variance means the observations are nearly the same (i.e., small variation); a large variance means they are quite different.
The *variance* can be expressed as a function of a random variable.


:::{.definition #Variance name="Variance"}
The *variance* of a random variable\ $X$ (or, of the distribution of\ $X$) is
$$
   \operatorname{var}[X]  = \operatorname{E}\big[(X - \mu)^2\big]
$$
where $\mu = \operatorname{E}[X]$.
The variance of\ $X$ is commonly denoted by\ $\sigma^2$, or\ $\sigma^2_X$ if distinguishing among variables is needed.
:::


The variance is the *expected value* of the squared distance of the values of the random variable from the mean, weighted by the probability function.
The unit of measurement for variance is the original unit of measurement *squared*.
That is, if\ $X$ is measured in metres, the variance of\ $X$ is in $\text{metres}^2$.

Describing the variability in terms of the original units is more natural, by taking the square root of the variance.


:::{.definition #StandardDeviation name="Standard deviation"}
The *standard deviation*\index{Standard deviation} of a random variable\ $X$ is defined as the *positive* square root of the variance (denoted by\ $\sigma$); i.e.,
$$
   \text{sd}[X] = \sigma = +\sqrt{\operatorname{var}[X]}
$$
:::

The variance is less popular than the standard deviation in practice to describe variability.
In theoretical work, however, the variance is easier to work with than standard deviation (due to the square root), and the variance, rather than standard deviation, features in many results in theoretical statistics.


:::{.example #VarianceDice name="Variance for a die toss"}
Suppose a fair die is tossed, and\ $X$ denotes the number of points showing. 
Then $\Pr(X = x) =  1/6$ for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ and
$$
   \mu = \operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_S x\,\Pr(X = x) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 )/6 = 7/2.
$$
The variance of\ $X$ is then
\begin{align*}
   \sigma^2 
   &= \operatorname{var}[X] = \sum (X - \mu)^2 \Pr(X = x)\\
   &= \frac{1}{6}\left[ \left(1 - \frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + \left(2 - \frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + \dots + \left(6 - \frac{7}{2}\right)^2 \right] = \frac{70}{24}.
\end{align*}
The standard deviation is then $\sigma = \sqrt{70/24} = 1.71$.
:::


An important result is the  *computational formula for variance*.


:::{.theorem #VarianceComputational name="Computational formula for variance"}
For any random variable\ $X$,\index{Variance!computational formula}
$$
   \operatorname{var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \operatorname{E}[X]^2.
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $\operatorname{E}[X] = \mu$, then (using the properties of expectation in Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpectationLinear)):
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{var}[X]
   = \operatorname{E}\left[(X - \mu)^2\right]
   &= \operatorname{E}[X^2 - 2X\mu + \mu^2] \\
   &= \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \operatorname{E}[2X\mu] + \operatorname{E}[\mu^2]\quad\text{(since $\operatorname{E}[\cdot]$ is a linear operator)}\\
   &= \operatorname{E}[X^2] - 2\mu\operatorname{E}[X] + \mu^2\\
   &= \operatorname{E}[X^2] - 2\mu^2 + \mu^2 \\
   &= \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 \\
   &= \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \operatorname{E}[X]^2.
\end{align*}
:::


This formula is often easier to use to compute $\operatorname{var}[X]$ than using the definition directly.


:::{.example #VarianceDice2 name="Variance for a die toss"}
Consider Example\ \@ref(exm:VarianceDice) again.
Then
\begin{align*}
  \operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_S x^2 \Pr(X = x) 
  &= \frac{1}{6}[1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 + 6^2]\\
  &= 91/6,
\end{align*}
and so $\operatorname{var}[X] = 91/6 - (7/2)^2 = 70/24$, as before.
:::



:::{.example #VarianceComputational name="Variance using computational formula"}
Consider the continuous random variable\ $X$ with pdf
$$
   f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
            3x(2 - x)/4  & \text{for $0 < x < 2$};\\
            0 & \text{elsewhere}.
            \end{cases}
$$
The variance of\ $X$ can be computed in two ways: using $\operatorname{var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[(X - \mu)^2]$ or using the computational formula.
The expected value of $X$ is
$$
   \operatorname{E}[X] = \int_0^2 x\times 3x(2 - x)4\, dx = 1.
$$
To use the computational formula, also find
$$
   \operatorname{E}[X^2] = \frac{6}{5},
$$
and so $\operatorname{var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \operatorname{E}[X]^2 = 1/5$.

Using the definition,
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{var}[X]
   = \operatorname{E}\big[(X - \operatorname{E}[X])^2\big]
   &= \operatorname{E}\big[(X - 1)^2\big]\\
   &= \int_0^2 (x - 1)^2 \times 3x(2 - x)/4\,dx = 1/5.
\end{align*}

Both methods give the same answer of course, and both methods require initial computation of $\operatorname{E}[X]$.
:::


The variance represents the expected value of the squared distance of the values of the random variable from the mean.
The variance is never negative, and is only zero when all the values of the random variable are identical (that is, there *is* no variation).

If most of the probability lies near the mean, the dispersion will be small; if the probability is spread out over a considerable range the dispersion will be large.


:::{.example #InfiniteVar name="Variance does not exist"}
\index{Variance!does not exist}
In Example\ \@ref(exm:InfiniteMean), $\operatorname{E}[X]$ was not defined.
For that reason, the variance is also undefined, since computing the variance relies on having a finite value for $\operatorname{E}[X]$.
:::


:::{.theorem #VarianceLinear name="Variance properties"}
For any random variable\ $X$ and constants\ $a$ and\ $b$,
$$
   \operatorname{var}[aX + b] = a^2\operatorname{var}[X].
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Using the computational formula for the variance:
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{var}[aX + b] 
   &= \operatorname{E}[ (aX + b)^2 ] - \left[\operatorname{E}[aX + b] \right] ^2\\
   &= \operatorname{E}[a^2 X + 2abX + b^2] + (a\mu+b)^2\\
   &= a^2 \operatorname{E}[X^2] - a^2\mu^2\\
   &= a^2 \operatorname{var}[X].
\end{align*}
:::


The special case $a = 0$ is instructive: $\operatorname{var}[b] = 0$ when $b$\ is constant; that is, a constant has *zero* variation, as expected.


:::{.example #VarancenFunctionY name="Variance of a function of a random variable"}
Consider the random variable $Y = 4 - 2X$ where $\operatorname{E}[X] = 1$ and $\operatorname{var}[X] = 3$.
Then:

  \operatorname{var}[Y]
  &= \operatorname{var}[4 - 2X] = (-2)^2\operatorname{var}[X] = 12.

## Higher moments {#HigherMoments}

### Raw and central moments {#RawCentralMoments}

The ideas of a mean and a variance can be generalised.
The mean is a special case of a 'raw moment', and the variance is a special case of a 'central moment'.


:::{.definition #RawMoments name="Raw moments"}
The *$r$th raw moment*, or *$r$th moment about the origin*, of a random variable\ $X$ (where\ $r$ is a positive integer) is denoted\ $\mu'_r$ and defined as $\mu'_r = \operatorname{E}[X^r]$.

For a discrete random variable\ $X$, the $r$th\ moment about the origin is
$$
  \mu'_r = \operatorname{E}[X^r] = \sum_X x^r\, p_X(x).
$$
For a continuous random variable\ $X$, the $r$th\ moment about the origin is
$$
   \mu'_r = \operatorname{E}[X^r] =  \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^r\, f_X(x)
$$
:::


:::{.definition #CentralMoments name="Central moments"}
The *$r$th central moment*, or *$r$th moment about the mean* (where\ $r$ is a positive integer), is denoted\ $\mu_r$ and defined as $\mu_r = \operatorname{E}[(X - \mu)^r]$.

For a discrete random variable\ $X$, the $r$th central moment is
$$
   \mu_r = \operatorname{E}[(X - \mu)^r] = \sum_x (x - \mu)^r\, p_X(x).
$$
For a continuous random variable\ $X$, the $r$th central moment is
$$
   \mu_r = \operatorname{E}\big[(X - \mu)^r\big] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^r\, f_X(x).
$$
:::


From these definitions:

* the mean $\mu'_1 = \mu$ is the *first raw moment*;
* $\mu'_2 = \operatorname{E}[X^2]$ is the *second raw moment*; and
* the variance $\mu_2 = \sigma^2$ is the *second central moment*.



### Skewness {#Skewness}

\index{Skewness|(}
Higher moments also exist that describe other features of a random variable.
The third central moment is related to *skewness*, a measure the asymmetry of a distribution.


:::{.definition #Symmetry name="Symmetry"}
The distribution of\ $X$ is said to be *symmetric*\index{Skewness!symmetric} if, for all $x\in \mathcal{R}_X$,

* $p_X(\mu + x) = p_X(\mu - x)$ for a discrete random variable\ $X$ with pmf $p_X(x)$, or
* $f_X(\mu + x) = f_X(\mu - x)$ for a continuous random variable\ $X$ with pdf $f_X(x)$,

where\ $\mu = \operatorname{E}[X]$ is the mean of\ $X$.
:::


For a symmetric distribution, the odd central moments are zero (Exercise\ \@ref(exr:SkewDiscreteCentralMomentsZero)).
This suggests that the odd central moments (such as the third central moment) can be used to measure the *asymmetry* of a distribution.

However, rather than using the third central moment explicitly, by applying Def.\ \@ref(def:CentralMoments), finding the appropriate expected value of a *normalised* version of the random variable (i.e., with mean zero and variance one) is preferred.
That is, the definition of skewness finds the appropriate expected value of $(X - \mu)/\sigma$ rather than of\ $X$ directly.
This means that the value of the skewness for the random variable\ $X$ is unaffected by a linear transformation of the type $Y = aX + b$ (for constants\ $a$ and\ $b$).


:::{.definition #Skewness name="Skewness"}
The *skewness* of the distribution of a random variable\ $X$ with mean $\operatorname{E}[X] = \mu$ and variance $\operatorname{var}[X] = \sigma^2$ is defined as\index{Skewness!definition}\index{Skewness}
\begin{align}
  \text{skewness} = \gamma_1 
  &= \operatorname{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^3\right]\notag\\
  &= \frac{\mu_3}{(\sigma^2)^{3/2}}
   = \frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}}.
  (\#eq:Skewness)
\end{align}
:::


If $\gamma_1 > 0$ we say the distribution is positively (or right) skewed,\index{Skewness!positive} and it is 'stretched' in the positive (negative) direction.
Similarly, if $\gamma_1 < 0$ we say the distribution is negatively (or left) skewed.\index{Skewness!negative}
The distribution is symmetric if $\gamma_1 = 0$.
For a symmetric distribution, the mean is also a median of the distribution, as these results show.

:::{.example #SkewnessCont name="Skewness"}
Consider the random variable\ $X$ in Example\ \@ref(exm:VarianceComputational), where $f_X(x) = x(2 - x)$ for $0 < x < 2$.
From that example, $\operatorname{E}[X] = \mu'_1 = 1$ and $\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \mu_2 = 6/5$.
Then,
$$
   \mu_3 = \int_0^2 (x - 1)^3\times 3x(2 - x)/4 \,dx = 0,
$$
so that the skewness in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:Skewness) will be zero.
This is expected, since the distribution is symmetric (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:VarianceComputationalPDF)).

### Kurtosis {#Kurtosis}

\index{Kurtosis|(}
Another description of a distribution is *kurtosis*, which measures the heaviness of the tails in a distribution; that is, how much of the probability of the random variable\ $X$ is concentrated in the extremes values of\ $X$.
This is related to the fourth central moment.
Again, finding the appropriate expected value of a *normalised* version of the random variable (i.e., with mean zero and variance one) is preferred.
That is, the definition of kurtosis finds the appropriate expected value of $(X - \mu)/\sigma$ rather than of\ $X$ directly.


:::{.definition #Kurtosis name="Kurtosis"}
The *kurtosis*\index{Kurtosis}\index{Kurtosis!definition} of a random variable\ $X$ with mean $\mu = \operatorname{E}[X]$ and variance $\sigma^2 = \operatorname{var}[X]$ is defined as
$$
  \text{kurtosis} 
  = \operatorname{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^4\right]
  = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu^2_2}.
$$
The *excess kurtosis*\index{Kurtosis!excess} of the distribution of a random variable is defined as
\begin{equation*}
     \gamma_2 = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu^2_2} - 3.
\end{equation*}
The *excess kurtosis* definition defines the excess kurtosis compared to a bell-shaped (normal distribution),\index{Normal distribution!kurtosis} which has an excess kurtosis of zero.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Excess kurtosis is so commonly used that is often just called 'kurtosis'.
:::


One way to understand kurtosis (from @moors1986meaning) is to first define $Z = (X - \mu)/\sigma$; then the kurtosis is, from Def.\ \@ref(def:Kurtosis), $\operatorname{E}[Z^4]$, and $\operatorname{E}[Z] = 0$ and $\operatorname{var}[X] = 1$.
Also observe that since $\operatorname{var}[X] =  \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \operatorname{E}[X]^2$ (the definition of variance), we can write
\begin{equation}
   \operatorname{E}[X^2] = \operatorname{var}[X] + \operatorname{E}[X]^2.
   (\#eq:VarianceRearranged)
\end{equation}
Then, the kurtosis is
\begin{align*}
  \operatorname{E}[Z^4]
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + \operatorname{E}[Z^2]^2\quad\text{(using Eq.~(\ref{eq:VarianceRearranged}))}\\
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + 
     \left\{ \operatorname{var}[Z] + \operatorname{E}[Z]^2\right\}^2\quad\text{(using Eq.~(\ref{eq:VarianceRearranged}) again)}\\
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + (1 + 0)^2 \\
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + 1.
\end{align*}
Thus, the kurtosis is related to the variance of\ $Z^2$ (not\ $Z$) about the mean.
That is, kurtosis emphasises focuses on the probability function in the extremes of the random variable.

Large values of kurtosis corresponds to greater proportion of the distribution in the tails.
Then (see Fig.\ \@ref(fig:KurtosisPlots)):

* distributions with *negative* excess kurtosis are called *platykurtic*.\index{Playtkurtic}
  These distribution have fewer, or less extreme, observations in the tail compared to the normal distribution ('thinner tails').
  Examples include the Bernoulli distribution (Sect.\ \@ref(BernoulliTrials)).
* distributions with *positive* excess kurtosis are called *leptokurtic*.\index{Leptokurtic}
  These distribution have more, or more extreme, observations in the tail compared to the normal distribution ('fatter tails').
  Examples include the exponential distribution (Sect.\ \@ref(ExponentialDistribution)) and Poisson distributions (Sect.\ \@ref(PoissonDistribution)).
* distributions with *zero* excess kurtosis are called *mesokurtic*.\index{Mesokurtic}
  The normal distribution (Sect.\ \@ref(Normal))\index{Normal distribution} is the obvious example.

Then,

   \operatorname{E}[X^4] &= \mu'_2 = \frac{2}{5}[ (-1)^4 + 1 ] = 4/5.
\end{align*}
Since $\operatorname{E}[U] = 0$, then the $r$th central and raw moments are the same: $\mu'_r = \mu_r$.
Notice that once the initial computations to find $\mu'_r$ are complete, the evaluation of any raw moment is simple.

The skewness is
$$
   \gamma_1 = \frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}} = \frac{0}{(4/5)^{3/2}} = 0, 
$$
so the distribution is symmetric.
The excess kurtosis is

   \gamma_2 = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2^2} -3 = \frac{4/5}{(4/5)^2} -3 = -7/4, 
$$
so the distribution is platykurtic.

## Moment-generating functions {#MGF}

\index{Moment-generating functions|(}

### Introduction {#MGFIntroduction}


By themselves, the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis do not completely describe a distribution; many different distributions can be found having a given mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis.
However, in general, *all* the moments of a distribution together define the distribution.
This leads to the idea of a *moment-generating function*.

Suppose I asked you to draw the probability density function of a random variable\ $X$, with $\operatorname{E}[X] = 2$.
Any of the six distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixDistributions) meet this (first moment) criterion, so this information is not sufficient to uniquely define a distribution.

So, suppose a second criterion is added: in addition, we require $\operatorname{var}[X] = 1$.
Any of the first five distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixDistributions) meet these two criteria (based on the first two moments), so again this information is not sufficient to uniquely define a distribution.

Suppose a third criterion is added: the distribution must be symmetric.
Any of the top four distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixDistributions) meet these three criteria (based on the first three moments); again, this information is not sufficient to uniquely define a distribution.

Suppose a fourth criterion is added: the distribution must have zero excess kurtosis.
Either of the top two distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixDistributions) meet these four criteria (based on the first four moments); again, this information is not sufficient to uniquely define a distribution.

In general, *all* the moments of a distribution are needed to uniquely define a distribution.
However, computing all (or even many) moments of a distribution is usually very tedious.
For this reason, the *moment generating function* (or MGF)\index{Moment generating function} is now introduced, a function that encapsulates *all* the moments of a distribution.

### Definition {#MGFDefinition}

So far, the distribution of a random variable has been described using a probability function or a distribution function.
Sometimes, however, working with a different representation is useful (for example, see Sect.\ \@ref(TransformationMoments)).

In this section, the *moment-generating function* is used to represent the distribution of the probabilities of a random variable.
As the name suggests, this function can be used to generate *any* moment of a distribution.
Other uses of the moment-generating function are seen later (see Sect.\ \@ref(TransformationMoments)).


:::{.definition #MGF name="Moment-generating function (MGF)"}
The *moment-generating function* (or MGF)\index{Moment-generating functions!definition}
 $M_X(t)$ of the random variable\ $X$ defined over a range\ $\mathcal{R}_X$ is denoted $M_X(t)$, and defined as 
$$
   \operatorname{E}\big[\exp(tX)\big], 
$$
provided the expectation exists for values of\ $t$ in some interval that includes $t = 0$.

When\ $X$ is a discrete random variable,
$$
  M_X(t)  = \operatorname{E}\big[\exp(tX)\big] = \sum_{x\in \mathcal{R}_X} \exp(tx)\, p_X(x).
$$
When\ $X$ is a continuous random variable,
$$
  M_X(t)  = \operatorname{E}\big[\exp(tX)\big] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(tx)\, f_X(x).
$$
:::

The MGF may not always exist (that is, converge to a finite value) for all values of\ $t$, so the MGF may not be defined for all values of\ $t$.
Note that the MGF always exists for $t = 0$; in fact $M_X(0) = 1$.

Provided the MGF is defined for some values of $t$ *other* than zero, it *uniquely* defines a probability distribution, and we can use it to easily generate the moments of the distribution, as described in Theorem\ \@ref(thm:Moments).


::: {.linkBox .link data-latex="{iconmonstr-link-1-240.png}"}
Moment-generating functions are related to Laplace transformations.
:::

:::{.example #MGF name="Moment-generating function"}
Consider the random variable\ $Y$ with pdf
$$
   f_Y(y) =
   \begin{cases}
      \exp(-y) & \text{for $y > 0$};\\
      0        & \text{elsewhere.}
   \end{cases}
$$
The MGF is
\begin{align*}
   M_Y(t)
    = \operatorname{E}[\exp(tY)] 
   &= \int_0^\infty \exp(ty)\,\exp(-y)\, dy \\
   &= \int_0^\infty \exp\{ y(t-1) \}\, dy \\
   &= (1 - t)^{-1}
\end{align*}
provided $t - 1 < 0$; that is, for $t < 1$ (which includes $t = 0$).
If $t > 1$, the integral does not converge. 
For example, if $t = 2$,
$$
   \left. \frac{1}{2 - 1} \exp(y)\right|_{y = 0}^{y = \infty} = \exp(0) - \lim_{y\to\infty} \exp(y)
$$

The moment generating function is

Consider the integrand $\exp(tx)/\big(\pi(1 + x^2)\big)$.
This integrand does not converge unless $t = 0$. 

For example, consider $t > 0$: as $x\to\infty$, we see $\exp(tx)\to\infty$, while $1/(1 + x^2)\to 0$ quite slowly; the integrand diverges (see Fig.\ \@ref(fig:MGFdiverges) (left panel) for an example when $t = 1$). 
Now consider $t < 0$: as $x\to-\infty$, we see $\exp(tx)\to\infty$, while $1/(1 + x^2)\to 0$ quite slowly; the integrand again diverges (see Fig.\ \@ref(fig:MGFdiverges) (right panel) for an example when $t = -1$). 

The integral only converges for $t = 0$.
The definition for the MGF states that the MGF exists 'provided the expectation exists for values of\ $t$ in some interval that includes $t = 0$'.

### Using the MGF to generate moments {#MGFMoments}

Replacing $\exp(xt)$ by its series expansion (App.\ \@ref(UsefulSeries)) in the definition of the MGF for a discrete random variable\ $X$ gives
\begin{align*}
     M_X(t) 
     & = {\sum_x} \left(1 + xt + \frac{x^2t^2}{2!} + \dots\right) \Pr(X = x)\\
     & = 1 + \mu'_1t + \mu'_2 \frac{t^2}{2!} +\mu'_3 \frac{t^3}{3!} + \dots
\end{align*}
Then,  the $r$th moment of a distribution about the origin is seen to be the coefficient of $t^r/r!$ in the series expansion of $M_X(t)$:
\begin{align*}
     \frac{d M_X(t)}{dt} 
     & = \sum_x x\,e^{xt}\Pr(X = x)\\
     \frac{d^2 M_X(t)}{dt^2} 
     & = \sum_x x^2\,e^{xt} \Pr(X = x),
\end{align*}
and, in general, for each positive integer\ $r$:
$$
   \frac{d^r M_X(t)}{dt^r} = \sum_x x^re^{xt}\Pr(X = x). 
$$
On setting $t = 0$,
\begin{align*}
 \left.\frac{d M_X(t)}{dt}\right|_{t = 0} &= \operatorname{E}[X]\\
 \left.\frac{d^2M_X(t)}{dt^2}\right|_{t = 0} &= \operatorname{E}[X^2].
\end{align*}
(The notation to the left means to evaluate the expression at $t = 0$.)
In general, for each positive integer\ $r$,
\begin{equation}
  \left.\frac{d^r M_X(t)}{dt^r}\right|_{t = 0} = \operatorname{E}[X^r].
\end{equation}
(Sometimes, $d^r M_X(t)/dt^r$ evaluated at $t = 0$ is written as $M^{(r)}(0)$ for brevity.)
This result is summarised in the following theorem.


:::{.theorem #Moments name="Moments"}
The $r$th moment\ $\mu'_r$ of the distribution of the random variable\ $X$ about the origin is given by either

1. the coefficient of $t^r/r!,  r = 1, 2, 3,\dots$ in the power series expansion of $M_X(t)$; or
2. $\displaystyle \mu'_r = \left.\frac{d^rM(t)}{dt^r}\right|_{t = 0}$ where $M_X(t)$ is the MGF of $X$.
:::


:::{.example #MeanVarMGF name="Mean and variance from a MGF"}
Continuing Example\ \@ref(exm:MGF), the mean and variance of\ $Y$ can be found from the MGF.
To find the mean, first find
$$
   \frac{d}{dt}M_Y(t) = (1 - t)^{-2}.
$$
Setting $t = 0$ gives the mean as $\operatorname{E}[Y] = 1$. 
Likewise,
$$
   \frac{d^2}{dt^2}M_Y(t) = 2(1 - t)^{-3}.
$$
Setting $t = 0$ gives $\operatorname{E}[Y^2] = 2$.
The variance is therefore $\operatorname{var}[Y] = 2 - 1^2 = 1$.

Once the moment-generating function has been computed, raw moments can be computed using
$$
   \operatorname{E}[Y^r] = \mu'_r = \left.\frac{d^r}{dt^r} M_Y(t)\right|_{t = 0}.
$$
:::



### Some useful results

The moment-generating function can be used to derive the distribution of a function of a random variable (see Sect.\ \@ref(TransformationMoments)).
The following theorems are valuable for this task.


:::{.theorem #MGFLinear name="MGF of linear combinations"}
If the random variable\ $X$ has MGF $M_X(t)$ and $Y = aX + b$ where\ $a$ and\ $b$ are constants, then the MGF of\ $Y$ is
$$
   M_Y(t) = \operatorname{E}\big[\exp\{t(aX + b)\}\big] = \exp(bt) M_X(at).
$$
:::



:::{.theorem #MGFIndependent name="MGF of independent rvs"}
If $X_1$, $X_2$, $\dots$, $X_n$ are $n$ independent random variables, where\ $X_i$ has MGF $M_{X_i}(t)$, then the MGF of $Y = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots X_n$ is
$$
   M_Y(t) = \prod_{i = 1}^n M_{X_i}(t).
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
The proofs are left as an exercise.
:::


Note that in the special case when all the random variables are independently and identically distributed in Theorem\ \@ref(thm:MGFLinear), we have
$$
   M_Y(t) = [M_{X_i}(t)]^n.
$$


:::{.example #MGFLinearCombinations name="MGF of linear combinations"}
Consider the random variable\ $X$ with pf
$$
   p_X(x) = 2(1/3)^x \qquad \text{for $x = 1, 2, 3, \dots$}
$$
and zero elsewhere.
The MGF of\ $X$ is
\begin{align*}
   M_X(t)
   &= \sum_{x: p(x) > 0} \exp(tx)\, p_X(x) \\
   &= \sum_{x = 1}^\infty \exp(tx)\, 2(1/3)^x \\
   &= 2\sum_{x = 1}^\infty (\exp(t)/3)^x \\
   &= 2\left\{ \frac{\exp(t)}{3} + \left(\frac{\exp(t)}{3}\right)^2
   + \left(\frac{\exp(t)}{3}\right)^3 + \dots\right\} \\
   &= \frac{2\exp(t)}{3 - \exp(t)}
\end{align*}
where $\sum_{y = 1}^\infty a^y = a/(1 - a)$ for $a < 1$ has been used (App.\ \@ref(UsefulSeries)); here $a = \exp(t)/3$.

Next consider finding the MGF of $Y = (X - 2)/3$.
From Theorem\ \@ref(thm:MGFLinear) with $a = 1/3$ and $b = -2/3$,
$$
   M_Y(t) 
   = \exp(-2t/3) M_X(t/3)
   = \frac{2\exp\{(-t)/3\}}{3 - \exp(t/3)}.
$$
In practice, rather than identify\ $a$ and\ $b$ and remember Theorem\ \@ref(thm:MGFLinear), problems like this are best solved directly from the definition of the MGF:
\begin{align*}
   M_Y(t) 
    = \operatorname{E}[\exp(tY)]
   &= \operatorname{E}[\exp\{t(X - 2)/3\}]\\
   &= \operatorname{E}[\exp\{tX/3 - 2t/3\}]\\
   &= \exp(-2t/3) M_X(t/3) \\
   &= \frac{2\exp\{(-t)/3\}}{3 - \exp(t/3)}.
\end{align*}
:::


### Determining the distribution from the MGF {#DistributionFromMGF}

The MGF (if it exists) completely determines the distribution of a random variable hence, given a MGF, deducing the probability function should be possible.
For some distributions, the pdf cannot be written in closed form (so the pdf can *only* be evaluated numerically; for example, see Sect.\ \@ref(TweedieModels)), but the MGF is relatively simple to write down.

For a *discrete* random variable\ $X$, the MGF is defined as
\begin{equation}
   M_X(t)
   = \operatorname{E}[\exp(tX)] 
   = \sum_X e^{tx} p_X(x)
   (\#eq:MGFtoPDFdiscrete)
\end{equation}
for\ $X$ discrete with pmf $p_X(x)$.
This can be expressed as
\begin{align*}
   M_X(t)
   &= \exp(t x_1) p_X(x_1) + \exp(t x_2)p_X(x_2) + \dots\\
   &= \exp(t x_1) \Pr(X = x_1) + \exp(t x_2)\Pr(X = x_2) + \dots\\
\end{align*}
and so the probability function of\ $Y$ can be deduced from the MGF.


:::{.example #DistFromMGF name="Distribution from the MGF"}
Suppose a discrete random variable\ $D$ has the MGF
$$
   M_D(t) = \frac{1}{3} \exp(2t) + \frac{1}{6}\exp(3t) + \frac{1}{12}\exp(6t)
   + \frac{5}{12}\exp(7t).
$$
Then, by the definition of the MGF in the discrete case given above, the coefficient of\ $t$ in the exponential indicates values of\ $D$, and the coefficient indicates the probability of that value of\ $Y$:
\begin{align*}
   M_D(t)
   &= \overbrace{\frac{1}{3} \exp(2t)}^{D = 2} + \overbrace{\frac{1}{6}\exp(3t)}^{D = 3} +
       \overbrace{\frac{1}{12}\exp(6t)}^{D = 6} + \overbrace{\frac{5}{12}\exp(7t)}^{D = 7}\\
   &= \Pr(D = 2)\exp(2t) + \Pr(D = 3)\exp(3t) + \\
   & \quad \Pr(D = 6)\exp(6t) + \Pr(D = 7)\exp(7t).
\end{align*}
So the pmf is
$$
   p_D(d) =
   \begin{cases}
      1/3 & \text{for $d=2$}\\
      1/6 & \text{for $d=3$}\\
      1/12 & \text{for $d=6$}\\
      5/12 & \text{for $d=7$}\\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
$$
(Of course, it is easy to check by computing the MGF for\ $D$ from the pf found above; you should get the original MGF.)
:::


Sometimes, using the results in App.\ \@ref(UsefulSeries) can be helpful.


:::{.example #DistFromMGF2 name="Distribution from the MGF"}
Consider the MGF
$$
   M_X(t) = \frac{\exp(t)}{3 - 2\exp(t)}.
$$
To find the corresponding probability function, one approach is to write the MGF as
$$
   M_X(t) = \frac{\exp(t)/3}{1 - 2\exp(t)/3}.
$$
This is the sum of a geometric series (Eq.\ \@ref(eq:SumGeometricInfinite)):
$$
   a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n - 1}
   \rightarrow \frac{a}{1 - r} \text{ as $n  \rightarrow  \infty$},
$$
where $a = \exp(t)/3$ and $r = 2\exp(t)/3$.
Hence the MGF can be expressed as
$$
   \frac{1}{3}\exp(t) + 
   \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \exp(2t) + 
   \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 \exp(3t) + \dots
$$
so that the probability function can be deduced as
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(X = 1) &= \frac{1}{3};\\
   \Pr(X = 2) &= \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right);\\
   \Pr(X = 3) &= \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2,
\end{align*}
or, in general,
$$
   p_x(x) = \frac{1}{3}\left( \frac{2}{3}\right)^{x - 1}\quad\text{for $x = 1, 2, 3, \dots$}.
$$
(Later, this will be identified as a [geometric distribution](#GeometricDistribution).)\index{Geometric distribution}
:::


For a *continuous* random variable\ $X$, the approach is more involved.
Suppose the continuous random variable\ $X$ has the MGF $M_X(t)$.
Then the probability density function is (see @abramowitz1964handbook, \S26.1.10)
\begin{equation}
   f_X(x) = 
   \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} M_X(it) \exp(-itx)\, dt,
   (\#eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous)
\end{equation}
where $i = \sqrt{-1}$.


:::{.example #DistFromMGFContinuous name="Distribution from the MGF"}
Consider the MGF for a continuous random variable\ $X$ such that $M_X(t) = \exp(t^2/2)$, for $y\in\mathbb{R}$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
Then, $M_X(it) = \exp\left( (it)^2/2 \right) = \exp(-t^2/2)$. 
Using Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous), the pdf is:
\begin{align*}
 f_X(x) 
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-t^2/2) \exp(-itx)\, dt,\\
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-t^2/2)\left[ \cos(-tx) + i\sin(-itx)\right]\, dt,
\end{align*}
since $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
Extracting just the real components:
\begin{align*}
 f_X(x) 
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-t^2/2) \cos(-tx) \, dt\\
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \left( \sqrt{2\pi} \exp( -x^2/2 ) \right)
  = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi} } \exp( -x^2/2 ),
\end{align*}
which will later be identified as a [normal distribution](#StandardNormal)\index{Normal distribution} with a mean of zero, and standard deviation of one.
:::


In practice, using Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) can become tedious or intractable for producing a closed form expression for the pdf.
However, Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) has been used to compute numerical values of the probability density function.
For example, @mypapers:Dunn:fourier used Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) to evaluate the *Tweedie distributions*\index{Tweedie distribution} [@mypapers:DunnSmyth:IWSM:2001], for which (in general) the pdf has no closed form, but does have a simple MGF.

## Tchebysheff's inequality {#Tchebysheff}

Tchebysheff's inequality\index{Tchebysheff's inequality} applies to any probability distribution, and is sometimes useful in theoretical work or to provide bounds on probabilities.


:::{.theorem #Tchebysheff name="Tchebysheff's theorem"}
Let\ $X$ be a random variable with finite mean\ $\mu$ and variance\ $\sigma^2$.
Then for any positive\ $k$,
\begin{equation}
   \Pr\big(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma \big)\leq \frac{1}{k^2}
   (\#eq:Tchebysheff)
\end{equation}
or, equivalently
\begin{equation}
   \Pr\big(|X - \mu| < k\sigma \big)\geq 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}.
\end{equation}
:::

:::{.proof}
The proof for the continuous case only is given.
Let\ $X$ be continuous with pdf\ $f(x)$.
For some $c > 0$, then
\begin{align*}
     \sigma^2 
     & = \int^\infty_{-\infty} (x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx\\
     & = \int^{\mu -\sqrt{c}}_{-\infty} (x - \mu )^2f(x)\, dx +
         \int^{\mu + \sqrt{c}}_{\mu-\sqrt{c}}(x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx +
         \int^\infty_{\mu + \sqrt{c}}(x - \mu)^2f(x)\,dx\\
     & \geq \int^{\mu -\sqrt{c}}_{-\infty} (x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx + 
       \int^\infty_{\mu + \sqrt{c}}(x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx,
\end{align*}
since the second integral is non-negative.
Now $(x - \mu )^2 \geq c$ if $x \leq \mu -\sqrt{c}$ or $x\geq \mu + \sqrt{c}$.
So in both the remaining integrals above, replace $(x - \mu )^2$ by $c$ without altering the direction of the inequality:
\begin{align*}
  \sigma^2 
  &\geq  c \int^{\mu -\sqrt{c}}_{-\infty} f(x)\,dx + c\int^\infty_{\mu + \sqrt{c}}f(x)\,dx\\
  &=  c\,\Pr(X \leq \mu - \sqrt{c}\,) + c\,\Pr(X \geq \mu + \sqrt{c}\,)\\
  &=  c\,\Pr(|X - \mu| \geq \sqrt{c}\,).
\end{align*}
Putting $\sqrt{c} = k\sigma$, Eq.\ \@ref(eq:Tchebysheff) is obtained.
:::


With the probability function or pdf of a random variable\ $X$, then $\operatorname{E}[X]$ and $\operatorname{var}[X]$ can be found, but the converse is not true. 
That is, from a knowledge of $\operatorname{E}[X]$ and $\operatorname{var}[X]$ we cannot reconstruct the probability distribution of\ $X$ and hence cannot compute probabilities such as $\Pr(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma)$.
Nonetheless, using Tchebysheff's inequality we can find a useful *bound* to either the probability outside or inside of $\mu \pm k\sigma$.


## Expectation for multivariate distributions 

### Expectations for bivariate distributions

In a manner analogous to the univariate case, the expectation of functions of two random variables can be given.


:::{.definition #BVExpectation name="Expectation for bivariate distributions"}
Let $(X, Y)$ be a $2$-dimensional random variable and let $u(X, Y)$ be a function of\ $X$ and\ $Y$. 

For a *discrete* bivariate distribution with probability mass function $p_{X, Y}(x, y)$ defined over $(x, y) \in R$, the *expectation* or *expected value* of $\operatorname{E}[u(X, Y)]$ is
$$
   \operatorname{E}[u(X, Y)]
   = \mathop{\sum\sum}_{(x, y)\in R} u(x, y)\, p_{X, Y}(x, y).
$$
For a *continuous* bivariate distribution with probability density function $f_{X, Y}(x, y)$ defined over $(x, y) \in R$, the *expectation* or *expected value* of $\operatorname{E}[u(X, Y)]$ is
$$
   \operatorname{E}[u(X, Y)]
   = \mathop{\sum\sum}_{(x, y)\in R} u(x, y)\, p_{X, Y}(x, y).
$$
:::


This definition can be extended to the expectation of a function of any number of random variables.


:::{.example #ExpectationFunctionTwoDiscrete name="Expectation of function of two rvs (discrete)"}
Consider the joint distribution of\ $X$ and\ $Y$ in Example\ \@ref(exm:BVDiscrete3). 
Determine $\operatorname{E}[X + Y]$; i.e., the mean of the number of heads plus the number showing on the die.

From Def.\ \@ref(def:BVExpectation), write $u(X, Y) = X + Y$ and so
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[X + Y] 
   &= \sum_{x = 0}^2 \sum_{y = 1}^6 (x + y)\, p_{X, Y}(x, y)\\
   &= 1\times(1/24) + 2\times(1/24) + \dots + 6\times(1/24)\\
   & \qquad + 2\times(1/12) + 3\times(1/12) + \dots + 7\times(1/12)\\
   & \qquad + 3\times(1/24) + 4\times(1/24) + \dots + 8\times(1/24)\\
   &= 21/24 + 27/12 + 33/24\\
   &= 4.5.
\end{align*}
The answer is just $\operatorname{E}[X] + \operatorname{E}[Y] = 1 + 3.5 = 4.5$.
This is no coincidence, as we see from Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpTwoRV).
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationFunctionTwoContinuous name="Expectation of function of two rvs (continuous)"}
Consider Example\ \@ref(exm:BVDiscreteBank).
To determine $\operatorname{E}[XY]$, write $u(X, Y) = XY$ and proceed:
$$
  \operatorname{E}[XY]
   = \frac{6}{5} \int_0^1\int_0^1 xy(x + y^2)\,dx\,dy
   = \frac7{20}.
$$
Unlike the previous example, an alternative simple calculation based on $\operatorname{E}[X]$ and $\operatorname{E}[Y]$ is not possible, since $\operatorname{E}[XY]\neq\operatorname{E}[X] \operatorname{E}[Y]$ in general.
:::


:::{.theorem #ExpTwoRV name="Expectations of two rvs"}
If\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are any random variables, and\ $a$ and\ $b$ are any constants, then
$$
   \operatorname{E}[aX + bY] = a\operatorname{E}[X] + b\operatorname{E}[Y].
$$
:::


This theorem is no surprise after seeing Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpectationLinear), but is powerful and useful. 
The proof given here is for the discrete case; the continuous case is analogous.

:::{.proof}
\begin{align*}
  \operatorname{E}[aX + bY]
  &= \mathop{\sum\sum}_{(x, y) \in R}(ax + by) \, p_{X, Y}(x, y), \text{ by definition}\\
  &= \sum_x \sum_y ax\, p_{X, Y}(x, y) + \sum_x \sum_y by\, p_{X, Y}(x, y)\\
  &= a\sum_x x\sum_y p_{X, Y}(x, y) + b\sum_y y\sum_x p_{X, Y}(x, y)\\
  &= a\sum_x x \Pr(X = x) + b\sum_y y \Pr(Y = y)\\
  &= a\operatorname{E}[X] + b\operatorname{E}[Y].
\end{align*}
:::


This result is true whether or not\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are independent.
Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpTwoRV) naturally generalises to the expected value of a *linear combination of random variables* (see Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpLinear)).



### Moments of a bivariate distribution: covariance

The idea of a moment in the univariate case naturally extends to the bivariate case. 
Hence, define $\mu'_{rs} = \operatorname{E}[X^r Y^s]$ or $\mu_{rs} = \operatorname{E}\big[(X - \mu_X)^r (Y - \mu_Y)^s\big]$ as the raw and central moments for a bivariate distribution.

The most important of these moments is the covariance.

:::{.definition #BVCovariance name="Covariance"}
The *covariance* of\ $X$ and\ $Y$ is defined as 
$$
   \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = \operatorname{E}[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)].
$$
When\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are discrete,
$$
   \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) =
   \sum_{x} \sum_{y} (x - \mu_X)(y - \mu_Y)\, p_{X, Y}(x, y).
$$
When\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are continuous,
$$
   \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) =
   \int_{-\infty}^\infty\!\int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu_X)(y - \mu_Y)\, f_{X, Y}(x, y)\, dx\, dy.
$$
:::

The covariance is a measure of how\ $X$ and\ $Y$ vary jointly, in the sense that a positive covariance indicates that 'on average'\ $X$ and\ $Y$ increase (or decrease) together whereas a negative covariance indicates that `on average' as\ $X$ increases and\ $Y$ decreases (and vice versa). 
We say that covariance is a measure of *linear dependence*.

Covariance is best evaluated from the computational formula.


:::{.theorem #Covariance name="Covariance"}
For any random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$,
$$
   \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)
   =
   \operatorname{E}[XY] - \operatorname{E}[X]\operatorname{E}[Y].
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
The proof uses Theorems\ \@ref(thm:ExpectationLinear) and\ \@ref(thm:ExpTwoRV).
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)
   &= \operatorname{E}\big[ (X - \mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)\big] \\
   &= \operatorname{E}[ XY - \mu_X Y - \mu_Y X + \mu_X\mu_Y] \\
   &= \operatorname{E}[ XY ] - \mu_X\operatorname{E}[Y] - \mu_Y\operatorname{E}[X] +  \mu_X \mu_Y \\
   &= \operatorname{E}[ XY ] - \mu_X\mu_Y - \mu_Y\mu_X +  \mu_X \mu_Y \\
   &= \operatorname{E}[ XY ] - \mu_X \mu_Y.
\end{align*}

Computing the covariance is tedious: $\operatorname{E}[X]$, $\operatorname{E}[Y]$, $\operatorname{E}[XY]$ need to be computed, and so the joint and marginal distributions of\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are needed.

Covariance has units given by the product of the units of\ $X$ and\ $Y$. 
For example, if\ $X$ is measured in metres and\ $Y$ is measured in seconds then $\operatorname{Cov}(XY)$ has the units metre--seconds.
To compare the strength of covariation amongst pairs of random variables, a unitless measure is useful.
Correlation does this by scaling the covariance in terms of the standard deviations of the individual variables.


:::{.definition #Correlation name="Correlation"}
The *correlation coefficient* between the random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$ is denoted by $\text{Corr}(X, Y)$ or $\rho_{X, Y}$ and is defined as
$$
   \rho_{X, Y} 
   = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sqrt{ \operatorname{var}[X]\operatorname{var}[Y]}}
   = \frac{\sigma_{X, Y}}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}.
$$
:::


If there is no confusion over which random variables are involved, we write\ $\rho$ rather than\ $\rho_{XY}$.
It can be shown that $-1 \leq \rho \leq 1$.


:::{.example #CorrCoefDiscrete name="Correlation coefficient (discrete rvs)"}
Consider two discrete random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$ with the joint pf given in Table\ \@ref(tab:Joint3).
To compute the correlation coefficient, the following steps are required.

* $\text{Corr}(X, Y) = \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)/\sqrt{ \operatorname{var}[X]\operatorname{var}[Y]}$, so $\operatorname{var}[X]$, $\operatorname{var}[Y]$ must be computed;
* To find $\operatorname{var}[X]$ and $\operatorname{var}[Y]$, $\operatorname{E}[X]$ and $\operatorname{E}[X^2]$, $\operatorname{E}[Y]$ and $\operatorname{E}[Y^2]$ are needed, so the marginal probability functions of\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are needed.

So first, the marginal pfs are
$$
   p_X(x) = \sum_{y = -1, 1} p_{X, Y}(x, y) =
      \begin{cases}
          7/24 & \text{for $x = 0$};\\
          8/24 & \text{for $x = 1$};\\
          9/24 & \text{for $x = 2$};\\
          0 & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
$$
and
$$
   p_Y(y) = \sum_{x = 0}^2 p_{X, Y}(x, y) =
      \begin{cases}
          1/2 & \text{for $y = -1$};\\
          1/2 & \text{for $y = 1$};\\
          0 & \text{otherwise.}
      \end{cases}
$$
Then,
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[X]   &= (7/24 \times 0) + (8/24 \times 1) + (9/24\times 2) = 26/24;\\
   \operatorname{E}[X^2] &= (7/24 \times 0^2) + (8/24 \times 1^2) + (9/24\times 2^2) = 44/24;\\
   \operatorname{E}[Y]   &= (1/2 \times -1) + (1/2 \times 1) = 0;\\
   \operatorname{E}[Y^2] &= (1/2 \times (-1)^2) + (1/2 \times 1^2) = 1,
\end{align*}
giving $\operatorname{var}[X] = 44/24 - (26/24)^2 = 0.6597222$ and $\operatorname{var}[Y] = 1 - 0^2 = 1$. 
Then,
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[XY] &= \sum_x\sum_y xy\,p_{X,Y}(x,y) \\
    &= (0\times -1 \times 1/8)  + (0\times 1 \times 1/6) + \cdots + (2\times 1 \times 1/4) \\
    &= 1/12.
\end{align*}
Hence,
$$
   \operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) 
   = \operatorname{E}[XY] - \operatorname{E}[X] \operatorname{E}[Y] 
   = \frac{1}{12} - \left(\frac{26}{24}\times 0\right) = 1/12,
$$
and
$$
   \text{Corr}(X,Y)
   = \frac{ \operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sqrt{ \operatorname{var}[X]\operatorname{var}[Y] } }
   = \frac{1/12}{\sqrt{0.6597222 \times 1}}
   = 0.1025978,
$$
so the correlation coefficient is about\ $0.10$, and a small positive linear association exists between\ $X$ and\ $Y$.

### Properties of covariance and correlation

* The correlation has no units.
* The covariance has units; if\ $X_1$ is measured in kilograms and\ $X_2$ in centimetres, then the units of the covariance are kg-cm.
* If the units of measurements change, the numerical value of the covariance changes, but the numerical value of the correlation stays the same.
   (For example, if\ $X_1$ is changed from kilograms to grams, the numerical value of the correlation will not change in value, but the numerical values of covariance will change.)
* The correlation is a number between\ $-1$ and\ $1$ (inclusive).
  When the correlation coefficient (or covariance) is negative, a *negative linear relationship* is said to exist between the two variables.
  Likewise, when the correlation coefficient (or covariance) is positive, a *positive linear relationship* is said to exist between the two variables.
* When the correlation coefficient (or covariance) is zero, no *linear* dependence is said to exist.


:::{.theorem #CovarianceProperties name="Properties of the covariance"}
For random variables\ $X$, $Y$ and\ $Z$, and constants\ $a$ and\ $b$:

* $\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = \operatorname{Cov}(Y, X)$.
* $\operatorname{Cov}(aX,bY) = ab\,\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)$.
* $\operatorname{var}[aX + bY] = a^2\operatorname{var}[X] + b^2\operatorname{var}[Y] + ab\,\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)$.
* If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\operatorname{E}[XY] = \operatorname{E}[X]\operatorname{E}[Y]$ and hence $\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$.
* $\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$ does not imply\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are independent, except for the special case of the bivariate normal distribution.
:::

A zero correlation coefficient in an indication of no *linear* dependence only.
A relationship may still exist between\ $X$ and\ $Y$ even if the correlation is zero.


:::{.example #LinearDependence name="Linear dependence and correlation"}
Consider\ $X_1$ with the pf:


| $x_1$   | $-1$  | $0$   | $1$
|---------|-------|-------|------
| $p_{X_1}(x_1)$ | $1/3$ | $1/3$ | $1/3$


Then, define\ $X_2$ to be explicitly related to\ $X_1$: $X_2 = X_1^2$.
So, we *know* a relationship exists between\ $X_1$ and\ $X_2$ (but it is  not linear). 
The joint pf for $(X_1, X_2)$ is shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:JointRship).å
Then
\begin{equation*}
   \operatorname{Cov}(X_1, X_2)
   = \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_2)] - \operatorname{E}[X_1]\operatorname{E}[X_2]
   = 0 - 0\times 2/3 = 0
\end{equation*}
so $\text{Corr}(X_1, X_2) = 0$. 
But\ $X_1$ and\ $X_2$ are *certainly related*, because\ $X_2$ was explicitly defined as a function of\ $X_1$.

Since the correlation is a measure of the strength of the *linear* relationship between two random variables, a correlation of zero simply is indication of no *linear* relationship between\ $X_1$ and\ $X_2$. 
(As is the case in this example, there may be a different relationship between the variables, but no linear relationship.)

### Conditional expectations {#ConditionalExpectation}

Conditional expectations are simply expectations computed from a conditional distribution.

The conditional mean is the expected value computed from a conditional distribution.

:::{.definition #ConditionalExpectation name="Conditional expectation"}
The *conditional expected value* or *conditional mean* of a random variable\ $X$ for given $Y = y$ is denoted by $\operatorname{E}[X \mid Y = y]$.

If the conditional distribution is discrete with probability mass function $p_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)$, then
$$
  \operatorname{E}[X \mid Y = y] =
  \displaystyle \sum_{x} x p_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y).
$$
If the conditional distribution is continuous with probability density function $f_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)$, then
$$
  \operatorname{E}[X \mid Y = y] =
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)\, dx.
$$
:::


$\operatorname{E}[X \mid Y = y]$ is typically denoted $\mu_{X \mid Y = y}$.


:::{.example #ConditionalMean name="Conditional mean (continuous)"}
Consider the two random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$ with joint pdf
$$
   f_{X, Y}(x, y) =
      \begin{cases}
         \frac{3}{5}(x + xy + y^2) & \text{for $0 < x < 1$ and $-1 < y < 1$};\\
         0 & \text{otherwise.}
      \end{cases}
$$
To find $f_{Y \mid X = x}(y\mid x)$, first $f_X(x)$ is needed:
$$
   f_X(x) = \int_{-1}^1 f_{X,Y}(x,y) dy = \frac{3}{15}(6x + 2)
$$
for $0 < x < 1$. 
Then,
$$
   f_{Y \mid X = x}(y \mid x)
   = \frac{ f_{X, Y}(x, y)}{ f_X(x) }
   = \frac{3(x + xy + y^2)}{6x + 2}
$$
for $-1 < y < 1$ and given $0 < x < 1$. 
The expected value of\ $Y$ given $X = x$ is then
$$
  \operatorname{E}[Y\mid X = x]
   = \frac{x}{3x + 1}.
$$
This expression indicates that the conditional expected value of\ $Y$ depends on the given value of\ $X$; for example,
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[Y\mid X = 0]   &= 0;\\
   \operatorname{E}[Y\mid X = 0.5] &= 0.2;\\
   \operatorname{E}[Y\mid X = 1]   &= 1/4.
\end{align*}
Since $\operatorname{E}[Y\mid X = x]$ depends on the value of\ $X$, this means\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are *not* independent.
:::


The conditional variance is the variance computed from a conditional distribution.

:::{.definition #ConditionalVariance name="Conditional variance"}
The *conditional variance* of a random variable\ $X$ for given $Y = y$ is denoted by $\operatorname{var}[X \mid Y = y]$.

If the conditional distribution is discrete with probability mass function $p_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)$, then
$$
  \operatorname{var}[X \mid Y = y] =
  \displaystyle \sum_{x} (x - \mu_{X\mid y})^2\, p_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y),
$$
where $\mu_{X \mid y}$ is the *conditional mean* of\ $X$ given $Y = y$.

If the conditional distribution is continuous with probability density function $f_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)$, then
$$
  \operatorname{var}[X \mid Y = y] =
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu_{X\mid y})^2\, f_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)\, dx.
$$
where $\mu_{X \mid y}$ is the *conditional mean* of\ $X$ given $Y = y$.
:::


For brevity, $\operatorname{var}[X \mid Y = y]$ is often denoted $\sigma^2_{X \mid Y = y}$.


:::{.example #ConditionVariance name="Conditional variance (continuous)"}
Refer to Example\ \@ref(exm:ConditionalMean). 
The conditional variance of\ $Y$ given $X = x$ can be found by first computing $\operatorname{E}[Y^2\mid X = x]$:
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[Y^2\mid X = x]
   &= \int_{-1}^1 y^2 f_{Y\mid X = x}(y\mid x)\,dy \\
   &= \frac{3}{6x + 2} \int_{-1}^1 y^2 (x + xy + y^2)\, dy \\
   &= \frac{5x + 3}{5(3x + 1)}.
\end{align*}
So the conditional variance is
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{var}[Y\mid X = x]
   &= \operatorname{E}[Y^2\mid X = x] - \left( \operatorname{E}[Y\mid X = x] \right)^2 \\
   &= \frac{5x+3}{5(3x + 1)} - \left( \frac{x}{3x + 1}\right)^2 \\
   &= \frac{10x^2 + 14x + 3}{5(3x + 1)^2}
\end{align*}
for given $0 < x < 1$. 
Hence the variance of\ $Y$ depends on the value of\ $X$ that is given; for example,
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{var}[Y\mid X = 0]   &= 3/5 = 0.6\\
   \operatorname{var}[Y\mid X = 0.5] &= \frac{10\times (0.5)^2 + (14\times0.5) + 3}{5(3\times0.5 + 1)^2} = 0.4\\
   \operatorname{var}[Y\mid X = 1]   &= 27/80 = 0.3375.
\end{align*}
:::


In general, to compute the conditional variance of $X\mid Y = y$ given a joint probability function, the following steps are required.

* Find the marginal distribution of\ $Y$.
* Use this to compute the conditional probability function $p_{X \mid Y = y}(x \mid y) = p_{X, Y}(x, y)/p_{X}(x)$.
* Find the conditional mean $\operatorname{E}[X \mid Y = y]$.
* Find the conditional second raw moment $\operatorname{E}[X^2 \mid Y = y]$.
* Finally, compute $\operatorname{var}[X\mid Y = y] = \operatorname{E}[X^2\mid Y=y] - (\operatorname{E}[X\mid Y=y])^2$.


:::{.example #ConditionalVar name="Conditional variance (discrete)"}
Two discrete random variables\ $U$ and\ $V$ have the joint probability function given in Table\ \@ref(tab:CondVar).
To find the conditional variance of\ $V$ given $U = 11$, use the steps above.

First, find the marginal distribution of\ $U$:
$$
      p_U(u) = \begin{cases}
         4/9 & \text{for $u = 10$};\\
         7/18 & \text{for $u = 11$};\\
         1/6 & \text{for $u = 12$};\\
         0 & \text{otherwise.}\\
         \end{cases}
$$
Secondly, compute the conditional probability function:
   \begin{align*}
      p_{V\mid U = 11}(v \mid u = 11)
      &= p_{U, V}(u,v)/p_{U}(u = 11) \\
      &= \begin{cases}
             \frac{1/18}{7/18} = 1/7 & \text{if $v = 0$};\\
             \frac{1/3}{7/18}  = 6/7 & \text{if $v = 1$}
          \end{cases}
   \end{align*}
   using $p_U(u = 11) = 7/18$ from the Step\ 1.

Thirdly, find the conditional mean:
$$
      \operatorname{E}[V\mid U = 11] = \sum_v v p_{V\mid U = 11}(v\mid u) =
         \left(\frac{1}{7}\times 0\right) + \left(\frac{6}{7}\times 1\right)  = 6/7.
$$
Fourthly, find the conditional second raw moment:
$$
      \operatorname{E}[V^2\mid U = 11] = \sum_v v^2 p_{V\mid U = 11}(v\mid u) =
         \left(\frac{1}{7}\times 0^2\right) + \left(\frac{6}{7}\times 1^2\right)  = 6/7.
$$
Finally, compute:
   \begin{align*}
      \operatorname{var}[V\mid U = 11] 
      &= \operatorname{E}[V\mid U = 11] - (\operatorname{E}[V\mid U = 11])^2\\
      &= (6/7) - (6/7)^2\\
      &\approx  0.1224.
   \end{align*}

    E[X_1] \\
    \vdots \\
    E[X_n]
  \end{bmatrix}.
$$

The *covariance matrix* is
$$
  \Sigma = \text{Cov}(\mathbf{X}) 
  = E\!\left[(\mathbf{X} - \boldsymbol{\mu})(\mathbf{X} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^T\right].
$$

The entries are $\Sigma_{ij} = \text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)$. 
The diagonal entries are variances, while the off-diagonal entries are covariances.  

The *correlation matrix* is obtained by normalisation:
$$
  \rho_{ij} = \frac{\Sigma_{ij}}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{ii}\,\Sigma_{jj}}}.
$$

### Independence

The components $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are independent if and only if
$$
  f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \prod_{i = 1}^n f_{X_i}(x_i).
$$

Linear combinations of random variables are most elegantly dealt with using the methods and notation of vectors and matrices, especially as the dimension grows beyond the bivariate case.
In the bivariate case we define
\begin{align}
   \mathbf{X} 
   &= \begin{bmatrix} 
       X_1 \\ 
       X_2 
      \end{bmatrix};
  \label{EQN:matrix1} \\
  \operatorname{E}[\mathbf{X}] 
  & =  \operatorname{E} 
  \left[ 
   \begin{bmatrix} 
      X_1 \\ 
      X_2
   \end{bmatrix} 
   \right]
   =  
   \begin{bmatrix} 
     \mu_1 \\
     \mu_2 
   \end{bmatrix} =
  \boldsymbol{\mu};\label{EQN:matrix2} \\
  \operatorname{var}[\mathbf{X}] 
  & = \operatorname{var}
  \left[
  \begin{bmatrix} 
     X_1 \\ 
     X_2
  \end{bmatrix} 
  \right]
  = 
  \begin{bmatrix} 
     \sigma^2_1  & \sigma_{12} \\
     \sigma_{21} & \sigma^2_2 
  \end{bmatrix} 
  = \mathbf{\Sigma}.\label{EQN:matrix3}
\end{align}

The vector\ $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the mean vector, and the matrix\ $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is called the *variance--covariance* matrix, which is square and symmetric since $\sigma_{12} = \sigma_{21}$.

The linear combination $Y = a_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2$ can be expressed
\begin{equation}
   Y 
   = a_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2 
   = [a_1, a_2]
   \begin{bmatrix} 
      X_1 \\ 
      X_2 
   \end{bmatrix} 
   = \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X}
   (\#eq:BivarCombination)
\end{equation}
where the (column) vector $\mathbf{a} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{bmatrix}$, and the superscript\ $T$ means 'transpose'.


### Independent random variables {#IndependentRVs}

Recall that events\ $A$ and\ $B$ are independent if, and only if,
$$
   \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A)\Pr(B).
$$
An analogous definition applies for random variables.


:::{.definition #Independent name="Independent random variables"}
The random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$ with joint distribution function\ $F_{X, Y}$ and marginal distribution functions\ $F_X$ and\ $F_Y$ are *independent* if, and only if,
\begin{equation}
   F_{X, Y}(x, y) = F_X(x) \times F_Y(y)
\end{equation}
for all\ $x$ and\ $y$.

If\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are not independent they are *dependent*, or *not independent*.
:::


The following theorem is often used to establish independence or dependence of random variables. 
The proof is omitted.


:::{.theorem}
The discrete random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$ with joint probability function $p_{X, Y}(x, y)$ and marginal distributions $p_X(x)$ and $p_Y(y)$ are *independent* if, and only if,
\begin{equation}
   p_{X, Y}(x, y) = p_X(x) \times p_Y(y) \text{ for every }(x, y) \in \mathcal{R}_{X \times Y}.
      (\#eq:IndependentDiscretervs)
\end{equation}
The continuous random variables $(X, Y)$ with joint pdf $f_{X, Y}$ and marginal pdfs $f_X$ and $f_Y$ are *independent* if, and only if,
\begin{equation}
   f_{X, Y}(x, y) = f_X(x)\times f_Y(y)
\end{equation}
for all\ $x$ and\ $y$.
:::

To show independence for continuous random variables (and analogously for discrete random variables) we must show $f_{X, Y}(x, y) = f_X(x)\times f_Y(y)$ for *all* pairs $(x, y)$.
If $f_{X, Y}(x, y)\neq f_X(x)\times f_Y(y)$, even for any one particular pair of $(x, y)$, then\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are dependent.

:::{.example #BVDiscreteIndependence name="Bivariate discrete: Independence"}
The random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$ have the joint probability distribution shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:Joint2).
Summing across rows, the marginal probability function of\ $Y$ is:
$$
   p_Y(y) = 
   \begin{cases}
      1/6  & \text{for $y = 1$};\\
      1/3  & \text{for $y = 2$};\\
      1/2  & \text{for $y = 3$}.
   \end{cases}
$$ 
To determine if\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are independent, the marginal probability function of\ $X$ is also needed:
$$
   p_X(x) = 
   \begin{cases}
      1/5  & \text{for $x = 1$};\\
      1/5  & \text{for $x = 2$};\\
      2/5  & \text{for $x = 3$};\\
      1/5  & \text{for $x = 4$}.
   \end{cases}
$$
Clearly, Eq.\ \@ref(eq:IndependentDiscretervs) is satisfied for all pairs $(x, y)$, so\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are independent.

:::{.example #BVContinuousIndependence name="Bivariate continuous: Independence"}
Consider the random variables\ $X$ and\ $Y$ with joint pdf
$$
   f(x, y)

Thus we have $f_X(x) \, f_Y(y) = f(x,y)$, so\ $X$ and\ $Y$ are independent.
:::


:::{.example #BVDiscreteIndependence2 name="Bivariate discrete: Independence"}
Consider again the random process in Example\ \@ref(exm:BVDiscrete3). 
The marginal distribution of\ $X_1$ was found in Example\ \@ref(exm:BVDiscreteMarginal3). 
The marginal distribution of\ $X_2$ is (check!)
$$
   p_{X_2}(x_2) =
   \begin{cases}
      \frac{1/24}{1/4} = 1/6 & \text{for $x_2 = 1$};\\
      \frac{1/24}{1/4} = 1/6 & \text{for $x_2 = 2$};\\

      \frac{1/24}{1/4} = 1/6 & \text{for $x_2 = 5$};\\
      \frac{1/24}{1/4} = 1/6 & \text{for $x_2 = 6$}.\\
   \end{cases}
$$
To determine if\ $X_1$ and\ $X_2$ are independent, *each*\ $x_1$ and\ $x_2$  pair must be considered. 
As an example, we see
\begin{align*}
   p_{X_1}(0) \times p_{X_2}(1) = 1/4 \times 1/6 = 1/24 &= p_{X_1, X_2}(0, 1);\\
   p_{X_1}(0) \times p_{X_2}(2) = 1/4 \times 1/6 = 1/24 &= p_{X_1, X_2}(0, 2);\\
   p_{X_1}(1) \times p_{X_2}(1) = 1/2 \times 1/6 = 1/12 &= p_{X_1, X_2}(1, 1);\\
   p_{X_1}(2) \times p_{X_2}(1) = 1/4 \times 1/6 = 1/24 &= p_{X_1, X_2}(2, 1).
\end{align*}
This is true for all pairs, and so\ $X_1$ and\ $X_2$ are independent random variables. 
Independence is, however, obvious from the description of the random process (Example\ \@ref(exm:BVDiscreteEG)), and is easily seen from Table\ \@ref(tab:JointPF).
:::

Consider the continuous random variables\ $X_1$ and\ $X_2$ with joint pdf

   \begin{cases}

      0 & \text{elsewhere.}
   \end{cases}
$$
The marginal distribution of\ $X_1$ is
$$
   f_{X_1}(x_1)
   = \int_1^2 \frac{2}{7}(x_1 + 2x_2)\,dx_2\\
   =   \frac{2}{7}(x_1 + 3)
$$
for $0 < x_1 < 1$ (and zero elsewhere). Likewise, the marginal distribution of\ $X_2$ is
$$
   f_{X_2}(x_2)

   = \frac{1}{7}(1 + 4x_2)
$$
for $1 < x_2 < 2$ (and zero elsewhere). 
(Both the marginal distributions must be valid density functions; verify!)
Since
$$
   f_{X_1}(x_1) \times f_{X_2}(x_2) = \frac{2}{49}(x_1 + 3)(1 + 4x_2) \ne f_{X_1, X_2}(x_1, x_2),
$$
the random variables\ $X_1$ and\ $X_2$ are *not independent*.

The conditional distribution of\ $X_1$ given $X_2 = x_2$ is
\begin{align*}
   f_{X_1 \mid X_2 = x_2}(x_1 \mid x_2)
   &= \frac{ f_{X_1, X_2}(x_1, x_2)}{ f_{X_2}(x_2)} \\
   &= \frac{ (2/7) (x_1 + 2x_2)}{ (1/7)(1 + 4x_2)}
\end{align*}
for $0 < x_1 < 1$ and any given value of $1 < x_2 < 2$. 
(Again, this conditional density must be a valid pdf.) 
So, for example,
$$
   f_{X_1 \mid X_2 = 1.5}(x_1\mid x_2 = 1.5)
   = \frac{ (2/7) (x_1 + 2\times 1.5)}{ (1/7)(1 + 4\times 1.5)}
   = \frac{2}{7}(x_1 + 3)
$$
for $0 < x_1 < 1$ and is zero elsewhere. 
And,
$$
   f_{X_1\mid X_2 = 1}(x_1 \mid 1)
   = \frac{ (2/7) (x_1 + 2\times 1)}{ (1/7)(1 + 4\times 1)}
   = \frac{2}{5}(x_1 + 2)
$$
for $0 < x_1 < 1$ and is zero elsewhere. 
Since the distribution of\ $X_1$ depends on the given value of\ $X_2$, $X_1$ and\ $X_2$ are *not* independent.

### Expectation {#MutlivariateExpectation}

Results involving expectations naturally generalise from the bivariate to the multivariate case.
Firstly, the expectation of a linear combination of random variables. 


:::{.theorem #ExpLinear name="Expectation of linear combinations"}
If $X_1, X_2,\dots, X_n$ are random variables and $a_1, a_2,\ldots a_n$ are any constants then
$$
   \operatorname{E}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i X_i \right]
   =\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i \, \operatorname{E}[X_i]
$$
:::


:::{.proof}
The proof follows directly from Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpTwoRV) by induction.
:::


The variance of a linear combination of random variables is given in the following theorem.


:::{.theorem #LinearCombVariance name="Variance of a linear combination"}
If $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are random variables and $a_1, a_2,\ldots a_n$ are any constants then
$$
   \operatorname{var}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i X_i \right]
   =
   \sum^n_{i = 1}a^2_i\operatorname{var}[X_i] + 2{\sum\sum}_{i<j}a_i a_j\operatorname{Cov}(X_i, X_j).
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
For convenience, put $Y = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_iX_i$.
Then by definition of variance
\begin{align*}
     \operatorname{var}[Y] 
     &= \operatorname{E}\big[Y - \operatorname{E}(Y)\big]^2\\
     &= \operatorname{E}[a_1 X_1 + \dots + a_n X_n - a_1\mu_1 - \dots a_n\mu_n]^2\\
     &= \operatorname{E}[a_1(X_1 - \mu_1) + \dots + a_n(X_n - \mu_n)]^2\\
     &= \operatorname{E}\left[ \sum_i a^2_i(X_i - \mu_i)^2 + 2\mathop{\sum\sum}_{i < j}a_i a_j(X_i - \mu_i)X_j - \mu_j)\right]\\
     &= \sum_i a^2_i\operatorname{E}[X_i - \mu_i]^2 + 2\mathop{\sum\sum}_{i < j}a_i a_j\operatorname{E}[X_i - \mu_i] (X_j - \mu_j)\\
        %\quad \text{using Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpLinear)}\\
     &= \sum_i a^2_i\sigma^2_i + 2\mathop{\sum\sum}_{i<j}a_i a_j\operatorname{Cov}(X_i, X_j).
\end{align*}
:::

In statistical theory, an important special case of Theorem\ \@ref(thm:LinearCombVariance) occurs when the\ $X_i$ are independently and identically distributed (IID). 
That is, each of $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ has the same distribution and are independent of each other. 
(We see the relevance of this in Chap.\ \@ref(SamplingDistributions).)
Because of its importance this special case is called a corollary of Theorems\ \@ref(thm:ExpLinear) and\ \@ref(thm:LinearCombVariance).

:::{.corollary #IID name="IID rvs"}
If $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are independently distributed (IID) random variables, each with mean\ $\mu$ and variance\ $\sigma^2$, and $a_1, a_2,\ldots a_n$ are any constants, then
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i X_i \right]
   &= \mu\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i;\\ 
   \operatorname{var}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i X_i \right]
   &= \sigma^2\sum^n_{i = 1}a^2_i.
\end{align*}

Exercise!

### Vector formulation {#Vectors}

With the standard rules of matrix multiplication, Theorems\ \@ref(thm:ExpLinear) and\ \@ref(thm:LinearCombVariance) applied to Eq.\ \@ref(eq:BivarCombination) then give respectively (check!)
\begin{equation}
   \operatorname{E}[Y]
   = \operatorname{E}[\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X}]
   = [a_1, a_2]
   \begin{bmatrix} 
      \mu_1 \\ 
      \mu_2 
    \end{bmatrix} 
   = \mathbf{a}^T\boldsymbol{\mu}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{var}[Y]
  &= \operatorname{var}[\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{a}]\nonumber\\
  &= [a_1, a_2]
  \begin{bmatrix} 
     \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{12} \\
     \sigma_{21}& \sigma^2_2 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} 
     a_1 \\ 
     a_2
  \end{bmatrix} \nonumber\\
  &= \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{a}.
\end{align}

The vector formulation of these results apply directly in the multivariate case as described below.
Write
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{X} 
  &= [X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n]^T; \\
     \operatorname{E}[\mathbf{X}] 
  &= [\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_n]^T = \boldsymbol{\mu}^T; \\
     \operatorname{var}[\mathbf{X}]
  &= \mathbf{\Sigma}; \\
     \mathbf{a}^T & = \left[a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n \right].
\end{align*}
Now Theorems\ \@ref(thm:ExpLinear) and\ \@ref(thm:LinearCombVariance) can be expressed in vector form.


:::{.theorem #MeanVarVector name="Bivariate mean and variance (vector form)"}
If\ $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector of length\ $n$ with mean\ $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and variance\ $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, and\ $\mathbf{a}$ is any constant vector of length\ $n$, then
\begin{align*}
   \operatorname{E}[\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X}]
   &= \mathbf{a}^T\boldsymbol{\mu}; \\
   \operatorname{var}[\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X}] 
   &= \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{a}.
\end{align*}
:::

:::{.proof}
Exercise.

These elegant statements concerning linear combinations are a feature of vector formulations that extend to many statistical results in the theory of statistics.
One obvious advantage of this formulation is the implementation in vector-based computer programming used by packages such as **R**.

One further result is presented (without proof) involving two linear combinations.


:::{.theorem #LinearCombCovar name="Covariance of combinations"}
If\ $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector of length\ $n$ with mean\ $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and variance\ $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, and\ $\mathbf{a}$ and\ $\mathbf{b}$ are any constant vectors, each of length\ $n$, then
$$
   \operatorname{Cov}(\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X},\mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{X}) 
   = 
   \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{b}.
$$

Consider the random variables $Y_1 = 3X_1 + 2X_2 - X_3$ and $Y_2 = X_3 - X_1$. 
Determine $\operatorname{E}[Y_1]$, $\operatorname{E}[Y_2]$, $\operatorname{var}[Y_1]$, $\operatorname{var}[Y_2]$ and $\operatorname{Cov}(Y_1,Y_2)$.

A vector formulation of this problem allows us to use Theorems\ \@ref(thm:MeanVarVector) and\ \@ref(thm:LinearCombCovar) directly. 
Putting $\mathbf{a}^T = [3, 2, -1]$ and $\mathbf{b}^T = [-1, 0, 1]$:
$$
   Y_1 = \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X}
   \quad\text{and}\quad 
   Y_2 = \mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{X}
$$
where $\mathbf{X}^T = [X_1, X_2, X_3]$.
Also define $\boldsymbol{\mu}^T = [1, 2, 3]$ and 
$\mathbf{\Sigma} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
  4 & -1 & 1\\
 -1 & 5 & 0\\
  1 & 0 & 6
\end{bmatrix}$ 
as the mean and variance--covariance matrix respectively of $\mathbf{X}$.
Then
$$
   \operatorname{E}[Y_1]
   = \mathbf{a}^T\boldsymbol{\mu}
   = [3, 2, -1]
   \begin{bmatrix} 
      1\\
      2\\
      3
      \end{bmatrix} 
   = 4
$$
and
$$
   \operatorname{var}[Y_1]
   = \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{a}
   = [3, 2, -1]

## Numerical approaches

Some distributions cannot be written in closed form (i.e., a neat function of standard mathematical functions), which makes (for example) evaluation of probability and computation of means difficult.
In these cases, numerical methods, such as numerical integration, may be needed.

Consider the random variable\ $X$ with density function
$$
  f_X(x) = \frac{c}{\sqrt{x}}\exp( -x - \sqrt{2x})\quad \text{for $x > 0$}.
$$
for some normalising constant\ $c$.
This density function has no closed form, and the value of\ $c$ cannot be found via integration.
However, the value of\ $c$ could be found using numerical integration in **R** using `integrate()`:

```{r}
### Define the function, without the constant term
g <- function(x){
  ifelse(x > 0, 
         x^(-0.5) * exp(-x - sqrt(2 * x)), # When x > 0
         0)                                # When x <= 0
}

### Integrate between 0 and infinity:
#\n adds a "new line"
Const <- 1 / integrate(g, 
                       lower = 0, 
                       upper = Inf)$value
cat("The value of  c  is about", round(Const, 4), "\n")

# So now define f(x):
f <- function(x){
  ifelse(x > 0, 
         x^(-0.5) * exp(-x - sqrt(2 * x)) * Const,  # When x > 0
         0)                                         # When x <= 0
}
```

That is, $c = 1.0784\dots$.
The distribution function can even be found:

```{r}
F <- function(x){
  F <- array(dim = length(x) )
  for (i in 1:length(x)){
    F[i] <- integrate( f, 
                       lower = 0,
                       upper = x[i])$value
  }
  return(F)
}

```

So now the density and the distribution function can be plotted (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:plotOddFnFig)):


```{r plotOddFn, fig.show='hide'}
### Make room for two plots side-by-side
par( mfrow = c(1, 2))

### Evaluate over these values of x
x <- seq(0.01, 2, 
         length = 1000)

### Now plot
plot( f(x) ~ x,
      type = "l",
      las = 1,
      lwd = 3,
      main = "Density function",
      xlab = expression(italic(x)),
      ylab = "Density fn.")
plot( F(x) ~ x,
      type = "l",
      las = 1,
      lwd = 3,
      main = "Distribution function",
      xlab = expression(italic(x)),
      ylab = "Distribution fn.")
```

```{r, plotOddFnFig, fig.cap='The density function (left) and distribution function (right) of a distribution that cannot be expressed in closed form.', fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
<<plotOddFn>>
```


Probabilities can then be computed; for example, we can find $\Pr(X > 0.5)$:

```{r}
integrate(f,
          lower = 0.5,
          upper = Inf)
```

And the expected value of\ $X$, $\operatorname{E}[X]$, can be found:

```{r}
f_Expected <- function(x){
  x * f(x)
}
integrate(f_Expected, 
          lower = 0,
          upper = Inf)
```

:::{.exercise #InvertMGFcontinuous}
In practice, some distributions cannot be written in closed form, but can be given by writing their moment-generating function. 
To evaluate the density then requires an infinite summation or an infinite integral. 
Given a moment-generating function $M(t)$, the probability density function can be reconstructed numerically from
the integral using the *inversion formula* in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous).

The evaluation of the integral generally requires advanced numerical techniques. 
In this question, we just consider the exponential distribution as a simple example to demonstrate the use of the inversion formula.

1. Write down the expression in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) in the case of the *exponential distribution*, for which $M_X(t) = \lambda/(\lambda - t)$ for $t < \lambda$. 
2. Only the real part of the integral is needed.
   Extract the real parts of this expression, and simplify the integrand. 
   (The integrand is the expression to be integrated.) 
3. Plot the integrand from the last part from $t = -50$ to $t = 2$ in the case $\lambda = 2$ and $x = 1$.

:::{.exercise #PooledTest2}
(This exercise follows from Ex.\ \@ref(exr:PooledTest).)
To detect disease in a population through a blood test, usually every individual is tested.
If the disease is uncommon, however, an alternative method is often more efficient.

In the alternative method (called a *pooled test*), blood from\ $n$ individuals is combined, and one test is conducted.
If the test returns a negative result, then none of the\ $n$ people have the disease; if the test returns a positive result, all\ $n$ individuals are then tested individually to identify which individual(s) have the disease.

Suppose a disease occurs in an unknown proportion of people\ $p$ of people.
Let $X$ be the number of tests to be performed for a group of\ $n$ individuals.

1. What is the expected number of tests needed in a group of\ $n$ people using the pooled method?
1. What is the variance of the number of tests needed in a group of\ $n$ people using the pooled method?
1. Explain what happens to the mean and variance as $p \to 1$ and as $p \to 0$, and how these results make sense *in the context of the question*
1. If pooling was *not* used with a group of $n$\ people, the number of tests would be\ $n$: one for each person.
   Deduce an expression for the value of\ $p$ for which the expected number of tests using the pooled approach *exceeds* the non-pooled approach.
1. Produce a well-labelled plot showing the expected number of tests that are *saved* by using the pooled method when $p = 0.1$ for values of $n$ from $2$ to $10$, and comment on what this shows practically.
1. Suppose a test costs \$$15$.
   What is the expected cost-saving for using the pooled-testing method with $n = 4$ and $p = 0.1$, if $200$ people must be tested?
