## Introduction

In this chapter, some popular continuous distributions are discussed.
Properties such as definitions and applications are considered.


## Continuous uniform distribution {#ContinuousUniform}

The continuous uniform distribution has a constant pdf over a given range.

:::{.definition #ContinuousUniformDistribution name="Continuous uniform distribution"}
If a random variable $X$ with range space $[a, b]$ has the pdf  
\begin{equation}
   f_X(x; a, b) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{b - a}\quad\text{for $a\le x\le b$},
   (\#eq:ContinuousUniformPMF)
\end{equation}
then $X$ has a *continuous uniform distribution*.
We write $X\sim U(a, b)$ or $X\sim\text{Unif}(a, b)$.
:::

This distribution is also called the *rectangular distribution*.
The same notation is used to denote the discrete and continuous uniform distribution; the context should make it clear which is meant. 
A plot of the pdf for a continuous uniform distribution is shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:ContinuousUniform).


```{r ContinuousUniform, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The pdf for a continuous uniform distribution $U(a,b)$.",fig.width=4,fig.height=3.5}

lines( x = c(7, 7),

       lty = 3)
```



:::{.definition #ContinuousuniformDF name="Continuous uniform distribution: distribution function"}
For a random variable $X$ with the continuous uniform distribution given in \@ref(eq:ContinuousUniformPMF), the distribution function is  
\[
  F_X(x; a, b) = 
  \begin{cases}
    0                                  & \text{for $x < a$};\\
    \displaystyle \frac{x - a}{b - a}  & \text{ for $a \le x \le b$};\\ 
    1                                  & \text{for $x > b$}.
  \end{cases}
\]
:::



The following are the basic properties of the continuous uniform distribution.

:::{.theorem #ContUniformProperties name="Continuous uniform distribution properties"}
If $X\sim\text{Unif}(a,b)$ then

1. $\text{E}(X)  = (a + b)/2$.
2. $\text{var}(X) = (b - a)^2/12$.
3. $M_X(t) = \{ \exp(bt) - \exp(at) \} / \{t(b - a)\}$.
:::


:::{.proof}
These proofs are left as exercises.
:::



::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
The four **R** functions for working with the continuous uniform distribution have the form `[dpqr]unif(min, max)` (see Appendix \@ref(UseRDistributions)).
:::



:::{.example #ContinuousUniform name="Continuous uniform"}
If $X$ is uniformly distributed on $[-2, 2]$, then $\Pr(|X| > \frac{1}{2})$ can be found.
Note that  
\[
  f_X(x; a = =2, b = 2) = \frac{1}{4} \quad\text{for $-2 < 2$.}
\]
Then:  
\begin{align*}
     \Pr\left(|X| > \frac{1}{2}\right) 
     &= \Pr\left(X > \frac{1}{2}\right) + \Pr\left(X < -\frac{1}{2}\right)\\
     &= \int^2_{\frac{1}{2}} f(x)\,dx  +  \int^{-\frac{1}{2}}_{-2} f(x)\,dx\\
     &= \frac{3}{4}.
\end{align*}
The probability could also be computed by finding the area of the appropriate rectangle.
Alternatively, in **R**:
```{r}
punif(-0.5, -2, 2) + 
  1 - punif(0.5, -2, 2)
```

## Normal distribution {#Normal}

### Definition and properties {#NormalUsual}

The most well-known continuous distribution is probably the *normal distribution* (or *Gaussian distribution*), sometimes called the *bell-shaped* distribution.
The normal distribution has many applications (especially in [sampling](SamplingDistributions)), and many natural quantities (such as heights and weights of humans) follow normal distributions.


:::{.definition #NormalDistribution name="Normal distribution"}
If a random variable $X$ has the pdf  
\begin{equation}
   f_X(x; \mu, \sigma^2) =
   \displaystyle \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}
                 \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 \right\}
   (\#eq:NormalPMF)
\end{equation}
for $-\infty<x<\infty$, then $X$ has a *normal distribution*.
The two parameters are the mean $\mu$ such that $-\infty < \mu < \infty$; and the variance  $\sigma^2$ such that $\sigma^2 > 0$.
We write $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.
:::


Some authors---especially in non-theoretical work---use the notation $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ so it is wise to check each article or book for the notation used.
Some examples of normal distribution pdfs are shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:Normal).

```{r Normal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Some examples of normal distributions. The solid lines correspond to $\\sigma = 0.5$ and the dashed lines to $\\sigma = 1$. For the left panel, $\\mu = -3$; for the right panel, $\\mu = 2$.", fig.height=3.5, fig.width=7, out.width='80%'}

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

z <- seq(-3.5, 3.5,
         length = 100)

mu <- c(-3, 2)
sigma <- c(0.5, 1)

for (i in (1:2)){
   x <- mu[i] + z * max(sigma)
   muvalue <- mu[i]
   plot( x,
         dnorm(x, 
               mean = mu[i], 
               sd = sigma[1]),
         type = "l",
         xlab = expression(italic(x)),
         ylab = "Probability function",
         lwd = 2,
         las = 1,
         main = bquote("Normal distribution: " ~ mu == .(muvalue))
         )
   lines( x,
         dnorm(x, 
               mean = mu[i], 
               sd = sigma[2]),
         lty = 2,
         lwd = 2)
   
}
```


In drawing the graph of the normal pdf, note that

1. $f_X(x)$ is symmetrical about $\mu$: $f_X(\mu - x) = f_X(\mu + x)$.
2. $f_X(x) \to 0$ asymptotically as $x\to \pm \infty$.
3. $f_X'(x) = 0$  when $x = \mu$, and a maximum occurs there.
4. $f_X''(x) = 0$ when $x = \mu \pm \sigma$ (points of inflection).


The proof that $\displaystyle \int^\infty_{-\infty} f_X(x)\,dx = 1$ is not obvious so will not be given.
The proof relies on first squaring the integral and then changing to polar coordinates.


:::{.definition #NormalDF name="Normal distribution: distribution function"}
For a random variable $X$ with the normal distribution given in \@ref(eq:NormalPMF), the distribution function is  
\begin{align}
  F_X(x; \mu, \sigma^2) 
  = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} 
    \int_{-\infty}^x 
    \exp\left\{\frac{(t - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}\, dt\\
  = \frac{1}{2} 
    \left\{1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma {\sqrt{2}} }\right)\right\}
\end{align}
where $\operatorname{erf}(\cdot)$ is the *error function*  
\begin{equation}
  \operatorname{erf}(x) = 
  \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int _{0}^{x} \exp\left( -t^{2}\right)\,dt,
  (\#eq:ErrorFunction)
\end{equation}
for $x \in\mathbb{R}$.
The function $\operatorname{erf}(\cdot)$ appears in numerous places, is commonly tabulated, and available in many computer packages.
:::


The following are the basic properties of the normal distribution.

:::{.theorem #NormalProperties name="Normal distribution properties"}
If $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ then

1. $\text{E}(X) = \mu$.
2. $\text{var}(X) = \sigma^2$.
3. $M_X(t) = \displaystyle \exp\left(\mu t + \frac{t^2\sigma^2}{2}\right)$.
:::

:::{.proof}
The proof is delayed until after the Theorem \@ref(thm:StandardNormalProperties).
:::


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
The four **R** functions for working with the normal distribution have the form `[dpqr]norm(mean, sd)` (see Appendix \@ref(UseRDistributions)).
Note that the normal distribution is specified by giving the *standard deviation* and **not** the *variance*.

The error function $\operatorname{erf}(\cdot)$ is not available directly in **R**, but can be evaluated using  
\[
  \operatorname{erf}(\cdot) = 2\times \texttt{pnorm}(x\sqrt{2}) - 1.
\]
:::


### The standard normal distribution {#StandardNormal}

A special case of the normal distribution is the *standard normal* distribution, when the normal distribution has mean zero and variance one.


:::{.definition #StandardNormal name="Standardard normal distribution"}
The pdf for a random variable $Z$ with a *standard normal distribution* is  
\[
   f_Z(z) = \displaystyle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
                                \exp\left\{ -\frac{z^2}{2}\right\}
   (\#eq:StandardNormalPMF)
\]
where $-\infty < z < \infty$.
We write $Z\sim N(0, 1)$.
:::

Since $f_Z(z)$ is a pdf, then  
\begin{equation}
   \frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int^\infty_{-\infty} \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2} z^2\right\}\,dz = 1,
   (\#eq:ZDistribution)
\end{equation}
a result which proves useful in many contexts (as in the proof of the second statement in \@ref(thm:GammaFunctionProperties), and in the proof below).



:::{.definition #StandardNormalDF name="Standard normal distribution: distribution function"}
For a random variable $X$ with the standard normal distribution given in \@ref(eq:StandardNormalPMF), the distribution function is  
\begin{align}
  F_X(x)
  &= \frac{1}{2} 
     \left\{1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \frac {x}{\sqrt{2}} \right)\right\}\nonumber\\
  &= \int_{-\infty}^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left\{ -\frac{t^2}{2}\right\}\, dt \\
  &=  \Phi(z)  
  (\#eq:PhiFunction)
\end{align}
where $\operatorname{erf}(\cdot)$ is the *error function* \@ref(eq:ErrorFunction).
:::

:::{.definition #StdNormalPhiNotation name="Notation"}
The distribution function for the standard normal distribution is used so often that is has its own notation: $\Phi(\cdot)$.
The distribution function of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is then denoted $\Phi\big( (x - \mu)/\sigma\big)$.

Analogously, the pdf of the standard normal distribution is sometimes denoted by $\phi(\cdot)$, and hence the PDF of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is then denoted $\phi\big( (x - \mu)/\sigma\big)$.

**Note:** $\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx} \Phi(x) = \phi(x)$.
:::



The following are the basic properties of the standard normal distribution.


:::{.theorem #StandardNormalProperties name="Standard normal distribution properties"}
If $Z\sim N(0, 1)$ then

1. $\text{E}(Z) = 0$.
2. $\text{var}(Z) = 1$.
3. $M_Z(t) = \displaystyle \exp\left(\frac{t^2}{2}\right)$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Part 3 could be proven first, and used to prove Parts 1 and 2.
However, proving Parts 1 and 2 directly is constructive.
For the expected value:  
\begin{align*}
    \text{E}(Z)
    &= \frac {1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} 
       \int^\infty_{-\infty} z \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}z^2 \right\}\,dz\\
    &= \int^\infty_{-\infty} -\frac{d}{dz} \left(\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right\} \right)\, dz\\
    &= \left[ -\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right\}\right]^\infty_{-\infty} = 0,
\end{align*}
since the integrand is symmetric about $0$.

For the variance, first see that $\text{var}(Z) = \text{E}(Z^2) - \text{E}(Z)^2 = \text{E}(Z^2)$ since $\text{E}(Z) = 0$.
So:  
\[
   \text{var}(X) = \text{E}(Z^2)
   = \frac {1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int^\infty_{-\infty}z^2e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2}\,dz.
\]
To integrate by parts (i.e., $\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\, du$), set $u = z$ (so that $du = 1$) and set  
\[
   dv = ze^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2}
   \quad\text{so that}\quad
   v = -e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2}.
\]
Hence,  
\begin{align*}
   \text{var}(X)
   &= \frac {1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left\{ -z \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right\} - \int^\infty_{-\infty}-\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right\}\, dz \right\}\\
   &= \frac {1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left(\left. -z\,\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2} z^2\right\}\right|^\infty_{-\infty}\right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int^\infty_{-\infty} \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right\}\,dz = 1
\end{align*}
since the first term is zero, and the second term uses \@ref(eq:ZDistribution).

For the mgf:  
\[ 
   M_Z(t) = \text{E}(\exp\left\{tZ\right\}) 
   = \int^\infty_{-\infty} \exp\left\{tz\right\} 
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right\}\,dz.
\]
Collecting together the terms in the exponent and completing the square,  
\begin{equation*}
     -\frac{1}{2}[z^2 -2tz] = -\frac{1}{2}(z - t)^2+\frac{1}{2} t^2.
\end{equation*}
Taking the constants outside the integral:  
\[ 
   M_Z(t) 
   = \exp\left\{\frac{1}{2}t^2\right\}\int^\infty_{-\infty}
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}[z - t]^2\right\}\,dz. 
\]
The integral here is 1, since it is the area under an $N(t, 1)$ pdf. 
Hence  
\[ 
   M_Z(t) = \exp\left\{\frac{1}{2} t^2\right\}.
\]
:::

This distribution is important in practice since *any* normal distribution can be rescaled into a standard normal distribution using  
\begin{equation}
   Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}.
   (\#eq:ConvertToZ)
\end{equation}
Since $Z = (X - \mu)/\sigma$, then $X = \mu + \sigma Z$, and so  
\[
   \text{E}(X) = \text{E}(\mu + \sigma Z) = \mu + \sigma \text{E}(Z) = \mu
\]
because $\text{E}(Z) = 0$.
Also  
\[
   \text{var}(X) = \text{var}(\mu  +\sigma Z) = \sigma^2\text{var}(Z) = \sigma^2
\]
because $\text{var}(Z) = 1$.
Finally  
\[
   M_X(t) = \text{E}(e^{tX}) = \text{E}\big(\exp\{t(\mu + \sigma Z)\}\big) = \exp(\mu t)\text{E}\big(\exp(t\sigma Z)\big).
\]
However, $\text{E}\big(\exp(t\sigma Z)\big) = M_Z(t\sigma) = \exp\left\{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma t)^2\right\}$ so   
\[
   M_Z(t) = \displaystyle \exp\left(\frac{t^2}{2}\right).
\]


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
The four **R** functions for working with the normal distribution have the form `[dpqr]norm(mean, sd)` (see Appendix \@ref(UseRDistributions)).
By default, `mean = 0` and `sd = 1`, corresponding to the standard normal distribution.
Note that the normal distribution is specified by giving the *standard deviation* and **not** the *variance*.
:::



### Determining normal probabilities {#FindNormalProbs}

The probability $\Pr(a < X \le b)$ where $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ can be written  
\[
   \Pr(a < X \le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a).
\]
where $F_X(x)$ is the distribution function in Def. \@ref(def:StandardNormalDF).
The integral in the distribution function cannot be written in terms of standard functions and in general must be evaluated for a particular $x$ numerically (e.g., using Simpson's rule or similar).
However, all statistical packages have built-in procedures to evaluate $F_X(x)$ for any $z$ (such as `pnorm()` in **R**).

Also, since any normal distribution can be transformed into a standard normal distribution, we can write  
\[
   z_1 = (a - \mu)/\sigma
   \quad\text{and}\quad
   z_2 = (b - \mu)/\sigma
\]
and hence the probability is   
\[
   \Pr( z_1 < Z \le z_2) = \Phi(z_2) - \Phi(z_1),
\]
where $\Phi(z)$ is the distribution function for the standard normal distribution \@ref(eq:ErrorFunction).

The process of converting a value $x$ into $z$ using $z = (x - \mu)/\sigma$ is called *standardising*.
Tables of $\Phi(z)$ (or sometimes $1 - \Phi(z)$) are commonly available.
These tables can be used to compute any probabilities associated with the normal distributions (see the examples below).
Of course, **R** can be used too.

In addition, the tables are often used in the reverse sense, where the probability of an event is given and the value of the random variable is sought.
In these case, the tables are used 'backwards'; the appropriate area is found in the body of the table and the corresponding $z$-value found in the table margins.
In **R**, the function `qnorm()` is used.
This $z$-value is then converted to a value of the original random variable using  
\begin{equation}
   x = \mu + z\sigma.
   (\#eq:Unstandardising)
\end{equation}
This process is sometimes referred to as *unstandardising*.

The following examples illustrate the use of **R**.
Drawing rough graphs showing the relevant areas is encouraged.



:::{.example #NormalWalkingSpeeds name="Walking speeds"}
A study of stadium evacuations used a simulation to compare scenarios [@xie2017improved].
The walking speed of people was modelled using a $N(1.15, 0.2^2)$ distribution; that is, $\mu = 1.15$ m/s with a standard deviation of 0.2m/s.
The situation can be shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:NormalWalkingSpeed), top left panel.

Many questions can be asked about the walking speeds, and **R** used to compute answers.
Using this model:

1. What is the probability that a person walks faster than 1.5m/s?
1. What is the probability that a person walks slower than 1.0m/s?
1. What is the probability that a person walks between 1.0m/s and 1.5m/s?
1. At what speed do the slowest 15% of people walk?
1. At what speed do the quickest 5% of people walk?

Sketches of each of these situations are shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:NormalWalkingSpeed).
Using **R**:

```{r}
# Part 1
1 - pnorm(1.5, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2)

# Part 2
pnorm(1, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2)

# Part 3
pnorm(1.5, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2) - 
   pnorm(1, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2)

# Part 4
qnorm(0.15, mean= 1.15, sd = 0.2)

# Part 5
qnorm(0.95, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2)
```
So the answers are, respectively:

1. `r round( 1 - pnorm(1.5, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2), 3) * 100`%;
1. `r round( pnorm(1, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2), 3) * 100`%;
1. `r round( pnorm(1.5, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2) - pnorm(1, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2), 3) * 100`%;
1. `r round( qnorm(0.10, mean= 1.15, sd = 0.2), 3)` m/s;
1. `r round( qnorm(0.95, mean = 1.15, sd = 0.2), 3)`m/s.

:::{.example #Exam name="Using normal distributions"}
An examination has mean score of 500 and standard deviation 100.
The top 75% of candidates taking this examination are to be passed.
Assuming the score has a normal distribution, what is the lowest passing score?

We have $X\sim N(500, 100^2)$. 
Let $x_1$ be such that  
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(X > x_1) 
   &= 0.75\\
   \Pr\left(Z > \frac{x_1 - 500}{100}\right) 
   &= 0.75\\
   \Pr\left(Z < \frac{500 - x_1}{100}\right) 
   & = 0.75.
\end{align*}
From tables, $0.75 = \Phi(0.675)$ so $(500 - x_1)/100 = 0.675$ and $x_1 = 432.5$.
Using **R**:

```{r}
qnorm(0.25, # Top 75% = bottom 25% 
      mean = 500,
      sd = 100)

### Normal approximation to the binomial {#NormalApproxBinomial}

In Sect. \@ref(BinomialDistribution), the binomial distribution was considered.
Sometimes using the binomial distribution is tedious; consider a binomial random variable $X$ where $n = 1000$, $p = 0.45$ and $\Pr(X > 650)$ is sought: we would calculate $\Pr(X = 651) + \Pr(X = 652) + \cdots + \Pr(X = 1000)$. 

However, sometimes the normal distribution can be used to *approximate* binomial probabilities.
For certain parameter values, the binomial pf starts to take on a normal distribution shape (Fig. \@ref(fig:NormalApprox)).

When is the binomial pf close enough to use the normal approximation?
There is no definitive answer; a common guideline suggests that if *both* $np \ge 5$ *and* $n(1 - p) \ge 5$ the approximation is satisfactory.
(These are only guidelines, and other texts may suggest different guidelines.)

Figure \@ref(fig:NormalApprox) shows some picture of various binomial probabilty functions overlaid with the corresponding normal distribution; the approximation is visibly better as the guidelines given above are satisfied.


```{r NormalApprox, echo=FALSE, , fig.height = 7, fig.width=7, out.width='85%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="The normal distribution approximating a binomial distribution. The guidelines suggest the approximation should be good when $np \\ge 5$ and $n (1 - p) \\ge 5$; this is evident from the pictures. In the top row, a significant amount of the approximating normal distribution even appears when $Y < 0$."}

The normal distribution can be used to *approximate* probabilities in situations that are actually binomial.
A fundamental difficulty with this approach is that a *discrete* distribution is being modelled with a *continuous* distribution.
This is best explained through an example.
The example explains the *principle*; the idea extends to all situations where the normal distribution is used to approximate a binomial distribution.


::: {.linkBox .link data-latex="{iconmonstr-link-1-240.png}"}
If the random variable $X$ has the binomial distribution $X \sim \text{Bin}(n, p)$, the probability function can be approximated by the normal distribution $Y \sim \text{Norm}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\mu = np$ and $\sigma^2 = np(1 - p)$.

The approximation is good if *both* $np \ge 5$ *and* $n(1 - p) \ge 5$.

:::{.example #NormalApproxMice name="Normal approximation to binomial"}
Consider *mdx* mice (which have a strain of muscular dystrophy) from a particular source for which $30$% of the mice survive for at least $40$ weeks.
One particular experiment requires at least $35$ of the $100$ mice to live beyond $40$ weeks.
What is the probability that **$35$ or more** of the group will survive beyond $40$ weeks?

First see that the situation is binomial; if $X$ is the number of mice from the group of $100$ that survive, then $X \sim \text{Bin}(100, 0.3)$.
This could be *approximated* by the normal distribution $Y\sim N(30, 21)$, where the variance is $np(1 - p) = 100\times 0.3\times 0.7 = 21$.
Both $np = 30$ and $n(1 - p) = 70$ are much larger than $5$, so this approximation is expected to adequate.

Figure\ \@ref(fig:ContCorrBoxes) shows the upper tail of the distribution near $X = 35$:
using the normal approximation from $Y = 35$, only *half* of the original bar in the binomial pf is included.
However, since the number of mice is discrete, we want the *entire* bar corresponding to $X = 35$.
So to compute the correct answer, the normal distribution must be evaluated for $\Pr(Y > 34.5)$.
This change from $Y \ge 34.5$ to $Y > 34.5$ is called using the *continuity correction*.

The exact answer (using the binomial distribution) is $0.1629$ (rounded to four decimal places).
Using the normal distribution *with* the continuity correction gives the answer as $0.1631$; using the normal distribution *without* the continuity correction, the answer is $0.1376$.
The solution is more accurate, as expected, using the continuity correction.

:::{.example #ContCorrectionDice name="Continuity correction"}
Consider rolling a standard die 100 times, and counting the number of times a `r knitr::include_graphics("Dice/die1.png", dpi=2000)` appear uppermost.
The random variable $X$ is the number of times a `r knitr::include_graphics("Dice/die1.png", dpi=2000)` appears; then, $X\sim \text{Bin}(n = 100, p = 1/6)$.

Since $np = 16.667$ and $n(1 - p) = 83.333$ are both greater than $5$, a normal approximation should be accurate, so define $Y\sim N(16.6667, 13.889)$ (where the variance is $np(1 - p) = 13.889$).
Various probabilities (Table \@ref(tab:ContCorrectionTable)) show the accuracy of the approximation, and the way in which the continuity correction has been used.

You should understand how the concept of the continuity correction has been applied in each situation, and be able to compute the probabilities for the normal approximation.

## Exponential distribution {#ExponentialDistribution}

One shortcoming of using the normal distribution in modelling is that it is defined for all real values, but many quantities are defined on the positive real numbers only.
This is not always a problem, especially when the observations are far from zero, such as heights of adult humans.
However, many random variables have observations close to zero, and the data are often skewed to the right (positively skewed).

Many distributions can be used for modelling right-skewed data defined on the positive real numbers; the simplest is the exponential distribution.


### Derivation {#ExponentialDerivation}

The exponential distribution is closely related to the Poisson distribution.

Consider a [Poisson process](#PoissonDerivation), where events occur at an average rate of $\lambda$ events per unit time (e.g., $\lambda = 0.5$ per minute).

Then consider a fixed length of time $t > 0$; then, the number of occurrences $Y$ would have an average rate of $\lambda t$ (e.g., in 12 minutes, we'd expect an average rate of $0.5\times 12 = 6$ occurrences).
That is, the number of events occurring in the interval $(0, t)$ has Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda t$, with probability function  
\begin{equation}
  p_Y(y) = \frac{\exp(-\lambda t) (\lambda t)^y}{y!}
  \quad
  \text{for $y = 0, 1, 2, \dots$}.
   (\#eq:PoissonPMF2)
\end{equation}
Hence, the probability that zero events occur in the interval $(0, t)$ is  
\[
  \Pr(Y = 0)
  = \frac{\exp(-\lambda t) (\lambda t)^0}{0!}  
  = \exp(-\lambda t)
\]
using $Y = 0$ in \@ref(eq:PoissonPMF2).

Now, introduce a new random variable $T$ that represent the *time until the first event occurs*.
Then, $Y = 0$ (i.e., no events occur in the interval $(0, t)$) corresponds to $T > t$ (i.e., the time till the first event occurs must be great than the time interval $t$).
That is,  
\[
  \Pr(Y = 0) = \exp(-\lambda t) = \Pr(T  > t).
\]
Rewriting in terms of a distribution function for $T$,  
\[
  F_T(t) = 1 - \Pr(T > t) = 1 - \exp(-\lambda t)
\]
for $t > 0$.
Hence, the probability density function is  
\[
  f_T(t) = \lambda \exp(-\lambda t)
\]
for $t > 0$.
This is the probability density function for the exponential distribution.

This shows that if events occur at random according to a Poisson distribution, then the time (or the space) *between* those events follows an exponential distribution (Theorem \@ref(thm:PoissonProcess)).
Hence the exponential distribution is used to describe the interval between consecutive randomly occurring events that follow a Poisson distribution.


:::{.theorem #PoissonProcess name="Poisson process and exponential distributions"}
Consider a Poisson process at rate $\lambda$ and suppose observation starts at an arbitrary time point. 
Then the time $T$ to the first event has an exponential distribution with mean $\text{E}(T) = 1/\lambda$; i.e.,  
\[
   f_T(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t},\quad t > 0.
\]
:::


Although the theorem refers to 'time', the variable of interest may be distance or any other continuous variable measuring the interval between events.


::: {.linkBox .link data-latex="{iconmonstr-link-1-240.png}"}
If events occur according to a Poisson distribution, then the "time" *between* the Poisson events can be modelled using an exponential distribution.

### Definition and properties {#ExponentialDefinition}

The exponential distribution is usually written as follows.


:::{.definition #ExponentialDistribution name="Exponential distribution"}
If a random variable $X$ has the pdf  
\begin{equation}
   f_X(x; \beta) = \displaystyle \frac{1}{\beta}  \exp(-x/\beta)
   \quad
   \text{for $x > 0$}
   (\#eq:ExponentialPMF)
\end{equation}
then $X$ has an *exponential distribution* with parameter $\beta > 0$. 
We write $X\sim\text{Exp}(\beta)$.
:::


The parameter $\lambda = 1/\beta$ is often used in place of $\beta$, and is called the *rate* parameter.
Sometimes the notation $X\sim\text{Exp}(\lambda)$, so checking which notation is being used in any context is wise.
Plots of the pdf for various exponential distributions are given in Fig. \@ref(fig:ExponentialDistributions)}.


```{r ExponentialDistributions, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Exponential distributions for various values of the rate parameter $\\lambda = 1/\\beta$",fig.width=4,fig.height=3.5}
x <- seq(0, 10,
         length = 100)

lambda <- c(0.5, 1, 2)

for (i in (1:length(lambda))){
  lambdai <- lambda[i]
  if (i == 1) {
     plot(x = x,
          y = dexp(x,
                   rate = 1/lambda[i]),
          xlab = expression(italic(x)),
          ylab = "Probability function",
          lwd = 2,
          las = 1,
          ylim = c(0, 1.5),
          type = "l",
          main = "Exponential distributions")
  } else {
    lines(x = x,
          y = dexp(x,
                   rate = 1/lambda[i]),
          lty = i,
          lwd = 2)
  }
}

legend( "topright",
        lty = 1:3,
        lwd = 2,
        legend = c(bquote(lambda == 0.5),
                   bquote(lambda == 1),
                   bquote(lambda == 2) )
        )
```


:::{.definition #ExponentialDF name="Exponential distribution: distribution function"}
For a random variable $X$ with the exponential distribution given in \@ref(eq:ExponentialPMF), the distribution function is  
\[
  F_X(x; \lambda) 
  = 1 - \exp\left\{-x/\beta\right\}
  = 1 - \exp\left\{-\lambda x\right\}
\]
for $x > 0$.
:::



The following are the basic properties of the exponential distribution.

:::{.theorem #ExponentialProperties name="Exponential distribution properties"}
If $X\sim\text{Exp}(\beta)$ then 

1. $\text{E}(X) = \beta = 1/\lambda$.
2. $\text{var}(X) = \beta^2 = 1/\lambda^2$.
3. $M_X(t) = (1 - \beta t)^{-1}$ for $t < 1/\beta$ (or, $M_X(t) = \lambda/(\lambda - t)$ for $t < \lambda$).
:::

:::{.proof}
The proofs are left as an exercise.
:::


The parameter $\beta$ represents the *mean* of the exponential distribution.
The alternative parameter $\lambda = 1/\beta$ represents the mean *rate* at which events occur.
Like the [Poisson distribution](#PoissonDistribution), the variance is defined once the mean is defined .


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
The four **R** functions for working with the exponential distribution have the form `[dpqr]exp(rate)` where `rate`${}= \lambda = 1/\beta$ (see Appendix \@ref(UseRDistributions)).
:::


:::{.example #ExpRainFall name="Exponential distributions"}
@allen1975stochastic use the exponential distribution to model daily rainfall in Kentucky.
:::


:::{.example #ExprainFall2 name="Exponential distributions"}
@cox1966statistical give data collected by Fatt and Katz concerning the time intervals between successive nerve pulses along a nerve fibre.
There are 799 observations which we do not give here.
The mean time between pulses is $\beta = 0.2186$ seconds. 
An exponential distribution might be expected to model the data well.
This is indeed the case (Fig. \@ref(fig:ExpNerves)).
What proportion of time intervals can be expected to be longer than 1 second?

If $X$ is the time between successive nerve pulses (in seconds), then $X\sim \text{Exp}(\beta = 0.2186)$ (so the *rate parameter* is $\lambda = 1/0.2186 = 4.575$ per second).
The solution will then be  
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(X > 1)
   &=  \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{0.2186}\exp(-x/0.2186)\, dx \\
   &= -\exp(-x/0.2186)\Big|_1^\infty \\
   &= (-0) + (\exp\{-1/0.2186\})\\
   &=  0.01031.
\end{align*}
There is about a 1% chance of a nerve pulse exceeding one second.

```


The relationship between the Poisson and exponential distribution was explored in Sect. \@ref(ExponentialDerivation) (see, for example, Theorem \@ref(thm:PoissonProcess)).
The next example explores this relationship


:::{.example #ExpPoisson name="Relationship between exponential and Poisson distributions"}
Suppose a Poisson process occurs at the mean *rate* of 5 events per hour.
Let $N$ represent the number of events in one day and $T$ the time between consecutive events. 
We can describe the distribution of the time between consecutive events and the distribution of the number of events in one day (24 hours).

Since events occur at the mean rate of $\lambda = 5$ events per hour, the mean time between consecutive events is $\beta = 1/\lambda = 0.2$ hours. 
Hence, the mean number of events in one day is $\mu = 24\times 5 = 120$.

Consequently, $N\sim\text{Pois}(\mu = 120)$ and  $X\sim\text{Exp}(\beta = 0.2)$ (or, equivalently, $X\sim\text{Exp}(\lambda = 5)$).
:::


An important feature of a Poisson process, and hence of the exponential distribution, is the *memoryless* or *Markov property*: the future of the process at any time point does not depend on the history of the process.
This property is captured in the following theorem.


:::{.theorem #MemorylessProperty name="Memoryless property"}
If $T \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$ where $\lambda$ is the *rate* parameter, then for $s > 0$ and $t > 0$,   
\[
    \Pr(T > s + t \mid T > s) = \Pr(T > t)
\]
:::

:::{.proof}
Using Definition \@ref(def:ConditionalProb),  
\[
   \Pr(T > s + t \mid T > s) 
   = \frac{ \Pr( \{T > s + t\} \cap \{T > s\})} {\Pr(T > s)}
\]
But if $T > s + t$, then $T > s$. 
Consequently $\Pr( \{T > s + t \}\cap \{T > s \} ) = \Pr(T > s + t)$ and so  
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(T > s + t \mid T > s )
   &= \frac{\Pr(T > s +t )}{\Pr(T > s)}\\
   &= \frac{\exp\left\{-\lambda(s + t)\right\}}{\exp\left\{-\lambda s\right\}}\\
   &= \exp\left\{-\lambda t\right\}\\
   &= \Pr(T > t).
\end{align*}
:::

This theorem states that the probability that the time to the next event is greater than $t$ does not depend on the time $s$ back to the previous event.
This is called the *memoryless property* of the exponential distribution.


:::{.example #Memoryless name="Memoryless property of exponential distribution"}
Suppose the lifespan of component $A$ is modelled by an exponential distribution with mean 12 months.
Then, $T \sim \text{Exp}(\beta = 6)$.

The probability that component $A$ fails in less than 6 months is  
\[
   \Pr(T < 6) = 1 - \exp(-6/12) = 0.3935.
\]

Now, suppose component $A$ has been in place for 12 months. 
The probability that it will fail in less than a further 6 months is  
\[
   \Pr(T < 18 | T > 12) = \Pr(T < 6) = 1 - \exp(-6/12) = 0.3935
\]
by the memoryless property.
:::


Example \@ref(exm:Memoryless) shows that an exponential process is 'ageless': the risk of 'mortality' remains constant with age.
That is, the probability of such an event occurring in the next small interval, whether the failure of a component or the occurrence of an accident, remains constant regardless of the age of the component or the length of time since the last accident. 
In this sense, an exponential lifetime is different from a human lifetime, or the lifetime of many man-made objects, where the risk of 'death' in the next small interval increases with age.


## Gamma distribution {#GammaDistribution}

Once the mean of an exponential distribution is defined, the variance is defined.
More flexibility is sometimes needed, which is provided by the gamma distribution.


:::{.definition #GammaDistribution  name="Gamma distribution"}
If a random variable $X$ has the pdf  
\[
   f_X(x; \alpha, \beta) 
   = \frac{1}{\beta^\alpha \Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha - 1} \exp(-x/\beta)
\]
then $X$ has a *gamma distribution*, where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the *gamma function* (see Sect. \@ref(def:GammaFunction)) and $\alpha, \beta > 0$.
We write $X \sim \text{Gam}(\alpha, \beta)$.
:::


The parameter $\alpha$ is called the *shape parameter* and $\beta$ is called the *scale parameter*.
Some texts use different notation for the shape and scale parameters.
In broad terms, the *shape* parameter dictates the general shape of the distribution; the *scale* parameter dictates how 'stretched out' the distribution is.


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
In **R**, the gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ is evaluated using `gamma(x)`.

The four **R** functions for working with the gamma distribution have the form `[dpqr]gamma(shape, rate, scale = 1/rate)`, where `shape`${}= \alpha$ and `scale`${}= \beta$ (see Appendix \@ref(UseRDistributions)).
:::


Plots of the gamma pdf for various values of the parameters are given in Fig. \@ref(fig:GammaDistribution).
In the bottom right panel, the gamma distributions are starting to look a bit like normal distributions.


::: {.linkBox .link data-latex="{iconmonstr-link-1-240.png}"}
The exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution with $\alpha = 1$.
This means that properties of the exponential distribution can be obtained by substituting $\alpha = 1$ into the formulae for the gamma distribution.
:::

alpha <- c(0.7, 2,
           3, 6)
beta <- c(0.5, 1, 2)


for (i in (1:length(alpha))){
  alphai <- alpha[i]
  
  if ( (i == 1) | ( i == 2 ) ) xmax <- 8
  if (i == 3) xmax <- 10

}
```


Notice that  
\begin{align}
   \int_0^\infty f_X(x)\,dx
   &= \int_0^\infty\frac{e^{-x/\beta}x^{\alpha - 1}}{\beta^\alpha\Gamma(\alpha)}\,dx\nonumber\\
   &= \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \int_0^\infty e^{-y} y^{\alpha-1}\,dy  \quad \text{(on putting $y = x/\beta$)}\nonumber \\
   &= 1,
   (\#eq:GammaStd)
\end{align}
because $\int_0^\infty \exp(-y) y^{\alpha-1}\,dy = \Gamma(\alpha)$.
 
The distribution function for the gamma distribution is complicated, involving incomplete gamma functions, and will not be given.
The following are the basic properties of the gamma distribution.


:::{.theorem #GammaProperties name="Gamma distribution properties"}
If $X\sim\text{Gam}(\alpha,\beta)$ then

1. $\text{E}(X) = \alpha\beta$.
2. $\text{var}(X) = \alpha\beta^2$.
3. $M_X(t) = (1-\beta t)^{-\alpha}$ for $t < 1/\beta$.
:::

:::{.proof}
For the expected value:  
\[
   \text{E}(X)
   = \int_0^{\infty}x f_X(x)\,dx 
   = \beta \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)}{\Gamma(\alpha)}
     \underbrace{\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\exp(-x/\beta) x^{(\alpha + 1) - 1}}{\beta^{\alpha + 1}\Gamma(\alpha + 1)} \, dx}_{= 1}
   = \alpha\beta.
\]
This result follows from using \@ref(eq:GammaStd) and Theorem \@ref(thm:GammaProperties)   
\[
   \text{E}(X^2)
   = \int_0^{\infty}x^2  f_X(x) \, dx 
   = \beta^2\frac{\Gamma(\alpha + 2)}{\Gamma(\alpha)}
     \underbrace{\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\exp(-x/\beta) x^{(\alpha + 2) - 1}}{\beta^{\alpha + 2}\Gamma(\alpha + 2)}\,dx}_{= 1}
   = \alpha(\alpha + 1)\beta^2
\]
where the result follows by writing $\Gamma(\alpha + 2) = (\alpha + 1)\alpha\Gamma(\alpha)$.
Hence  
\[
   \text{var}(X)
   = \text{E}(X^2) - [\text{E}(X)]^2
   = \alpha(\alpha + 1)\beta^2 - (\alpha\beta)^2
   = \alpha\beta^2
\]
Also:  
\begin{align*}
   M_X(t)
    = \text{E}(e^{Xt})
   &= \int_0^{\infty}\exp(tx) \frac{\exp(-x/\beta) x^{\alpha - 1}}{\beta^{\alpha} \Gamma(\alpha)} \, dx\\
   &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\exp\{-x(1 - \beta t)/\beta\}x^{\alpha - 1}}{\beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)} \, dx\\
   &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\exp(-z) z^{\alpha - 1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)(1 - \beta t)^{\alpha - 1}} \, \frac{dz} {1 - \beta t}, 
      \text{putting $z = x(1 - \beta t)/\beta$}\\ 
   &= (1 - \beta t)^{-\alpha},
\end{align*}
since the integral remaining is 1.
:::

As usual the moments can be found by expanding $M_X(t)$ as a series.
That is,  
\[
   M_X(t) = 1 \ + \ \alpha\beta t \ + \ \frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)\beta^2}{2!}  t^2 \ + \ \cdots
\]
from which  
\begin{align*}
   E(X)   &= \text{coefficient of }t =\alpha\beta,\\
   E(Y^2) &= \text{coefficient of }t^2/2!=\alpha(\alpha+1)\beta^2,
\end{align*}
as found earlier.
 
As for the normal distribution, the distribution function of the gamma cannot, in general, be computed without using numerical integration, tables (although see Example \@ref(exm:ElectricalComponent)) or software.


:::{.example #Rainfall name="Rainfall"}
@climate:das:1955 used a (truncated) gamma distribution for modelling daily precipitation in Sydney.
A similar approach is adopted by [@climate:wilks:1990].

@larsen1986introduction (Case Study 4.6.1) use the gamma distribution to model daily rainfall in Sydney, Australia using the parameter estimates $\alpha = 0.105$ and $\beta = 76.9$ (based on @climate:das:1955).
The comparison between the data and the model (Table \@ref(tab:GammaRain)) indicates a good agreement between the data and the theoretical distribution.

:::{.example #ElectricalComponent name="Electrical components"}
The lifetime of an electrical component in hours, say $T$, can be well modelled by the distribution $\text{Gam}(2, 1)$.
What is the probability that a component will last for more than three hours?

From the information, $T\sim \text{Gam}(\alpha = 2, \beta = 1)$.
The required probability is therefore  
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(T > 3)
   &= \int_3^\infty \frac{1}{1^2 \Gamma(2)}t^{2 - 1} \exp(-t/1)\,dt \\
   &= \int_3^\infty t \exp(-t)\,dt \\
\end{align*}
since $\Gamma(2) = 1! = 1$.
This expression can be integrated using integration by parts:  
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(T > 3)
   &= \int_3^\infty t \exp(-t)\,dt \\
   &= \left\{ -t \exp(-t)\right\}\Big|_3^\infty - \int_3^\infty -\exp(-t)\, dt \\
   &= [ (0) - \{-3\exp(-3)\}] - \left\{ \exp(-t)\Big|_3^\infty\right\} \\
   &= 3\exp(-3) + \exp(-3)\\
   &= 0.1991
\end{align*}

Integration by parts is only possible since $\alpha$ is integer.
If $\alpha$ was, for example $\alpha = 2.5$, integration by parts would not be possible.

A more general approach is to use tables of the incomplete gamma function to evaluate the integral, numerical integration, or software.
To use **R**:


```{r echo=TRUE}
# Integrate
integrate(dgamma, # The gamma distribution prob. fn
          lower = 3,
          upper = Inf,  # "Inf" means "infinity"
          shape = 2,
          scale = 1)

# Directly
1 - pgamma(3,
           shape = 2,
           scale = 1)
```

Using any method, the probability is about 20%.
:::


:::{.example #Gamma name="Gamma"}
If $X\sim \text{Gam}(\alpha, \beta)$, find the distribution of $Y = kX$ for some constant $k$.

One way to approach this question is to use moment-generating functions.
Since $X$ has a gamma distribution, $M_X(t) = (1-\beta t)^{-\alpha}$.
Now,  
\begin{align*}
   M_Y(t)
   &= \text{E}(\exp(tY)) \qquad\text{by definition of the mgf}\\
   &= \text{E}(\exp(t kX)) \qquad\text{since $X = kX$}\\
   &= \text{E}(\exp(s X)) \qquad\text{by letting $s = kt$}\\
   &= M_X(s) \qquad\text{by definition of the mgf}\\
   &= M_X(kt) \\
   &= (1 - \beta kt)^{-\alpha}.
\end{align*}
This is just the mgf for random variable $X$ with $k\beta$ in place of $\beta$, so the distribution of $Y$ is $\text{Gam}(\alpha, k\beta)$.
:::


## Beta distribution {#BetaDistribution}

Some continuous random variables are constrained to a finite interval. 
The beta distribution is useful in these situations.


:::{.definition #BetaDistribution name="Beta distribution"}
A random variable $X$ with probability density function  
\begin{equation*}
   f_X(x; m, n)
   = \frac{x ^ {m - 1}(1 - x)^{n - 1}}{B(m, n)} \quad \text{for $0\leq x \leq 1$ and $m > 0$, $n > 0$},
\end{equation*}
and $B(m, n)$ is the *beta function*  
\begin{align}
   B(m, n)
   &= \int_0^1  x^{m - 1}(1 - x)^{n - 1} \, dx, \quad \text{for $m > 0$ and $n > 0$}\nonumber\\
   &= \frac{\Gamma(m)\, \Gamma(n)}{\Gamma(m + n)},
   (\#eq:BetaFunction)
\end{align}
is said to have a *beta distribution* with parameters $m$ and $n$.
We write $X \sim \text{Beta}(m, n)$.
:::


$B(m, n)$ defined by \@ref(eq:BetaFunction) is known as the *beta function* with parameters $m$ and $n$.
Since $\int_0^1 f_X(x)\,dx = 1$ then  
\begin{equation}
   \int_0^1  \frac{x^{m - 1}(1 - x)^{n - 1}}{B(m, n)}\,dx = 1.
\end{equation}


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
In **R**, the beta function is evaluated using `beta(a, b)`, where `a`${} = m$ and `b`${} = n$.

The four **R** functions for working with the beta distribution have the form `[dpqr]beta(shape1, shape2)`, where `shape1`${}= m$ and `shape2`${}= n$ (see Appendix \@ref(UseRDistributions)).
:::

The distribution function for the beta distribution is complicated, involving incomplete beta functions, and will not be given.
Some properties of the beta function follow.


:::{.theorem #BetaFunctionProperties name="Beta function properties"}
The beta function \@ref(eq:BetaFunction) satisfies the following:

1. The beta function is symmetric in $m$ and $n$.
   That is, if $m$ and $n$ are interchanged, the function remains unaltered; i.e., $B(m, n) = B (n, m)$.
2. $B(1, 1) = 1$.
3. $B\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) = \pi$.
:::

:::{.proof}
To prove the first, put $z = 1 - x$ and hence $dz = -dx$ in \@ref(eq:BetaFunction). 
Then  
\begin{align*}
   B(m, n)
   &= -\int_1^0(1 - z)^{m - 1}  z^{n - 1} \, dz\\
   &= \int_0^1 z^{n - 1}(1 - z)^{m - 1} \, dz\\
   &= B(n, m).
\end{align*}

For the second, put $x = \sin^2\theta$, and so $dx = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta\,d\theta$, in \@ref(eq:BetaFunction).
We have  
\[
   B(m, n) = 2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2m - 1}\theta \cos ^{2n - 1}\theta\,d\theta.
\]
So, for $m = n = \frac{1}{2}$,  
\[
   B\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2\int_0^{\pi/2} d\theta = \pi.
\]

For the third, note that $\Gamma(1/2) = \sqrt{\pi}$ from Theorem \@ref(thm:GammaProperties).
Further, since $\Gamma(1) = 0! = 1$, the results follows.
:::


Typical graphs for the beta pdf are given in Fig. \@ref(fig:BetaDistributions). 
When $m = n$, the distribution is symmetric about $x = \frac{1}{2}$.



::: {.linkBox .link data-latex="{iconmonstr-link-1-240.png}"}
When $m = n = 1$, the beta distribution becomes the uniform distribution on $(0, 1)$.

Some basic properties of the beta distribution follow.


:::{.theorem #BetaDistributionProperties name="Beta distribution properties"}
If $X \sim \text{Beta}(m, n)$ then

1. $\text{E}(X) = m/(m + n)$.
2. $\displaystyle\text{var}(X) = \frac{mn}{(m + n)^2 (m + n + 1)}$.
3. A mode occurs at $\displaystyle x = \frac{m - 1}{m + n - 2}$ for $m, n > 1$.
:::


:::{.proof}
Assume $X \sim \text{Beta}(m, n)$, then  
\begin{align*}
   \mu_r'
   =\text{E}(X^r)
   &= \int_0^1  \frac{x^r  x^{m - 1}(1 - x)^{n - 1}} {B(m, n)}\,dx\\
   &= \frac{B(m + r, n)}{B(m, n)}  \int_0^1 \frac{x^{m + r - 1}(1 - x)^{n - 1}}{B(m + r, n)}\,dx\\
   &= \frac{\Gamma(m + r)\,\Gamma(n)}{\Gamma(m + r + n)} \frac{\Gamma(m + n)}{\Gamma(m)\,\Gamma(n)}\\
   &= \frac{\Gamma(m + r)\,\Gamma(m + n)}{\Gamma(m + r + n)\,\Gamma(m)}
\end{align*}
Putting $r = 1$ and $r = 2$ into the above expression, and using that $\text{var}(X) = \text{E}(X^2) - \text{E}(X)^2$, the mean and variance are $\text{E}(X) = m/(m + n)$ and $\text{var}(X) = \frac{mn}{(m + n)^2(m + n + 1)}$.

Any mode $\theta$ of the distribution for which $0 < \theta < 1$ will satisfy $f'_X(\theta) = 0$. 
From the definition we see that for $m, n>1$ and $0 < x < 1$,  
\[
   f'_X(x) = (m - 1)x^{m - 2} (1 - x)^{n - 1} - (n - 1)x^{m - 1}(1 - x)^{n - 1}/B(m, n) = 0
\]
implying $(m - 1)(1 - x) = (n - 1)x$ which is satisfied by $x = (m - 1) / (m + n - 2)$.
:::


The mgf of the beta distribution cannot be written in terms of standard functions.
The distribution function of the beta must be evaluated numerically in general, except when $m$ and $n$ are integers as shown in the example below.


If $X\sim \text{Beta}(m, n)$, then $X$ is defined on $[0, 1]$.
Sometimes then, the beta distribution is used to model proportions, though not proportions out of a total number (when the [binomial distribution](#BinomialDistribution) is used).
Instead, the beta distribution is used, for example, to model percentage cloud cover (for example, @falls1974beta).

For a random variable $Y$ defined on a different closed interval $[a, b]$, define $Y = X(b - a) + a$.




:::{.example}
@damgaard2019using use the beta-distribution to model the relative areas covered by plants of different species.
The beta distribution is a suitable model, since these relative areas are proportions.
In addition, the authors state that

>  ...plant cover data tend to be left-skewed (J-shaped), right skewed (L-shaped) or U-shaped (p. 2747)

which align with some of the plots in Fig. \@ref(fig:BetaDistributions).
:::

:::{.example #BetaTanks name="Beta distributions"}
The bulk storage tanks of a fuel retailed are filled each Monday.
The retailer has observed that over many weeks the proportion of the available fuel supply sold is well modelled by a beta distribution with $m = 4$ and $n = 2$.

If $X$ denotes the proportion of the total supply sold in a given week, the mean proportion of fuel sold each week is  
\[
   \text{E}(X) = m/(m + n) = 4/6 = 2/3.
\]

To find the probability that at least 90% of the supply will sell in a given week, compute:  
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(X > 0.9)
   &= \int_{0.9}^1\frac{\Gamma(4 + 2)}{\Gamma(4)\Gamma(2)}x^3(1 - x)dx\\
   &= 20\int_{0.9}^1 (x^3 - x^4))\,dx\\
   &= 20(0.004)\\
   &= 0.08
\end{align*}
It is unlikely that 90% of the supply will be sold in a given week.
In **R**:

```{r}
1 - pbeta(0.9, 
          shape1 = 4, 
          shape2 = 2)
```
:::


## Simulation {#SimulationContinuous}

As with discrete distributions (Sect. \@ref(SimulationDiscrete)), simulation can be used with continuous distributions.
Again, in **R**, random numbers from a specific distribution use functions that start with the letter `r`; for example, to generate random numbers from a normal distribution, use `rnorm()`:

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(107283)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
rnorm(3, # Generate three random numbers...
      mean = 4,     # ... with mean = 4
      sd = 2)       # ... with sd = 2
```

Suppose we are seeking women over 173cm tall for a study; what percentage of women are over 173cm tall?
Assume that adult females have heights modelled by a normal distribution with mean 163cm and a standard deviation of 5cm [@data:ABS1995:MeasureUp].
The percentage taller than 173 cm is:

```{r}
1 - pnorm(173, mean = 163, sd = 5)
```

Simulations can also be used, which allows us to consider more complex situations.
For this simple question initially (Fig. \@ref(fig:HeightSimHistograms), left panel):

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(17283)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
htW <- rnorm(1000,  # One thousand women
             mean = 163,  # Mean ht
             sd = 5)      # Sd of height
pcTallWomen <- sum( htW > 173 )/1000 * 100

cat("Percentage 'tall' women:", pcTallWomen, '%\n')
```

Now consider a more complex situation.
Suppose adult males have heights with a mean of 175cm with standard deviation of 7cm, and constitute 44% of the population.
Now, we are seeking women *or* men over 173cm tall (Fig. \@ref(fig:HeightSimHistograms), right panel):


```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(107423)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
personSex <- rbinom(1000,  # Select sex of each person
                    1,
                    0.44) # So 0 = Male; 1 = Female

htP <- rnorm(1000,  # change ht parameters according to sex
             mean = ifelse(personSex == 0,
                           175,
                           163),
             sd = ifelse(personSex == 0,
                         7, 
                         5))

pcTallPeople <- sum( htP > 173 )/1000 * 100
pcFemales <- sum( personSex == 1 ) / 1000 * 100

cat("Percentage 'tall' people:", pcTallPeople, '%\n\n')
cat("Percentage females:", pcFemales, '%\n\n')
cat("Percentage of 'tall' people that are female:", 
    round( sum(htP > 173 & personSex == 1) / sum(htP > 173) * 100, 1),
    '%\n\n')
cat("Variance of heights: ", var(htP), "\n")

:::{.exercise #BetaClay}
The percentage of clay content in soil has been modelled using a beta distribution.
In one study [@haskett1995use], two counties in Iowa were modelled with beta-distributions: County A with parameters $m = 11.52$ and $n = 4.75$, and County B with parameters $m = 3.85$ and $n = 3.65$. 

1. Plot the two distributions, and comment (in context).
1. Compute the mean and standard deviation of each county.
1. What percentage of soil samples exceed 50% clay in the two counties?
   Comment.

A study of water uptake in plants in grasssland and savanna ecosystems [@nippert2015challenging] used a beta distribution to model the distribution of root depth $D$.
The MRD (maximum root density) was 70cm, so the beta distribution used was defined over the interval $[0, 70]$.
For one simulation, the beta-distribution parameters were $m = 1$ and $n = 5$.

1. Plot the pdf, and explain what it means in this context.
2. Determine the probability that the root depth was deeper than 50cm.
3. Determine the root depth of the plants with the deepest 20% of roots.

:::{.exercise #Headway}
A *headway* is the time gap (front-bumper to front-bumper) separating consecutive motor vehicles in a lane of road traffic. 
Suppose headways $X$ (in seconds) on a section of a traffic lane are described by a *shifted gamma distribution*, with pdf  
\[
   f_X(x) = 
   \frac{1}{\beta^\alpha \Gamma(\alpha)} 
   (x - \Delta)^{\alpha - 1}
   \exp\left( -(x - \Delta)/\beta\right)
   \quad\text{for $x > \Delta$},
\]
where $\alpha = 2.5$, $\beta = 0.8$ and $\Delta = 1.2$.

1. Determine the theoretical mean and variance of this distribution.
1. Simulate 1000 headways using **R**, and plot a histogram of the data. 
   Comment.

Another commonly-used distribution is the *Weibull distribution*:  
\[
   f_Y(y) = \frac{k}{\lambda} \left( \frac{x}{\lambda} \right)^{k - 1} \exp( -(x/\lambda)^k)\quad\text{for $x > 0$},
\]
where $\lambda > 0$ is called a *scale parameter*, and $k > 0$ is called a *shape parameter*.

1. Produce some sketches in **R** to show the variety on the shapes of the density function.
1. Derive the mean and variance of the Weibull distribution.
1. Derive the cdf for the Weibull distribution.
