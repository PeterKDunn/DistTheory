## Mathematical expectation {#ExpectedValue}

Because random variables are *random*, knowing the outcome on any one realisation of the random process is not possible.
Instead, we can talk about what we might *expect* to happen, or what might happen *on average*.

This is the idea of *mathematical expectation*. 
In more usual terms, the mathematical expression of the probability distribution of a random variable is the *mean* of the random variable.
Mathematical expectation goes far beyond just computing means, but we begin here as the idea of a *mean* is easily understood.

The definition looks different in detail for discrete, continuous and mixed random variables, but the intention is the same.


:::{.definition #Expectation name="Expectation"}
The *expectation* or *expected value* (or *mean*) of a random variable\ $X$ is written $\text{E}[X]$ (or $\mu$, or $\mu_X$ to distinguish between random variables).

For a *discrete* random variable\ $X$ with pmf $p_X(x)$, the expected value is
$$
   \text{E}[X] = 
        \sum_{x\in R_X} x p_X(x).
$$
For a *continuous* random variable\ $X$ with pdf $f_X(x)$, the expected value is
$$
   \text{E}[X] = 
        \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x).
$$
:::

For a *mixed* random variable\ $X$, the expected value is a combination of the two above results, for the discrete and continuous components of\ $R_X$; that is,
$$
   \text{E}[X] = 
     \sum_{x_i} x_i \, p_X(x_i) + \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, f_X(x) \, dx,
$$
where $p_X(x)$ is the probability mass function over discrete points\ $x_i\in R_X$, and $f_X(x)$ is the probability density function (pdf) over the continuous regions of $x\in R_X$ with pdf $f_X(x)$.
In the rest of this chapter, the case of mixed random variable\ $X$ will not be explicitly discussed; however, the results remain a combination of the discrete case for the discrete points in\ $R_X$ and the continuous case for the continuous component of\ $R_X$.

Effectively $\text{E}[X]$ is a weighted average of the points in\ $R_X$, the weights being the probabilities for each value of $x\in R_X$ in the discrete case and probability densities in the continuous case.


:::{.example #ExpectationDiscrete name="Expectation for discrete variables"}
Consider the discrete random variable\ $U$ with probability function
$$
   p_U(u) = \begin{cases}
               (u^2 + 1)/5 & \text{for $u = -1, 0, 1$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere},
           \end{cases}
$$
so that $R_U = \{-1, 0, 1\}$.
The expected value of\ $U$ is
\begin{align*}
   \text{E}[U]
   &= \sum_{R_U} up_U(u) \\
   &= \sum_{R_U} u \times\left( \frac{u^2 + 1}{5} \right) \\
   &= \left( -1 \times \frac{(-1)^2 + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 0 \times \frac{(0)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 1 \times \frac{(1)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) \\
   &= -2/5 + 0 + 2/5 = 0.
\end{align*}
The expected value of\ $U$ is\ $\text{E}[U] = 0$.
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationContinuousX name="Expectation for continuous variables"}
Consider a continuous random variable\ $X$ with pdf
$$
   f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
               x/4 & \text{for $1 < x < 3$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere}.
            \end{cases}
$$
The expected value of\ $X$ is
\begin{align*}
   \text{E}[X]
   &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x) \, dx
    = \int_1^3 x(x/4)\, dx\\
   &= \left.\frac{1}{12} x^3\right|_1^3 = 13/6.
\end{align*}
The expected value of\ $X$ is $\text{E}[X] = 13/6$.
:::




:::{.example #ExpectationMixedX name="Expectation for mixed variables"}
Consider a continuous random variable\ $W$ with probability function
$$
  f_W(w) = 
  \begin{cases}
     1/2       & \text{for $w = 0$};\\
     \exp(-2w) & \text{for $w > 0$};\\
     0         & \text{elsewhere},
  \end{cases}
$$
so that $p_W(w) = 1/2$ for $w = 0$, and $f_W(w) = \exp(-2w)$ for $w > 0$.
The expected value of\ $W$ is 
\begin{align*}
   \text{E}[W]
   &= \overbrace{\sum_{w = 0} w p_W(w)}^{\text{Discrete component}} \quad + \quad \overbrace{\int_{-\infty}^\infty w f_W(w)\, dw}^{\text{Continuous component}}\\
   &= \sum_{w = 0} 0\times (1/2)\quad + \quad \int_{0}^\infty w \exp(-2w)\, dw\\
   &= 0 \quad + \quad 1/4\\
   &= 1/4.
\end{align*}
The expected value of\ $W$ is $\text{E}[W] = 1/4$.

:::{.example #ExpectationCoinOnce name="Expectation for a coin toss"}
Consider tossing a coin *once* and counting the number of tails.
Let this random variable be\ $T$.
The probability function is
$$
   p_T(t) = \begin{cases}
               0.5 & \text{for $t = 0$ or $t = 1$};\\
               0   & \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
$$
The expected value of\ $T$ is
\begin{align*}
   \text{E}[T]
   &= \sum_{i = 1}^2 t p_T(t)\\
   &= \Pr(T = 0) \times 0 \quad + \quad \Pr(T = 1) \times 1\\
   &= (0.5 \times 0) \qquad + \qquad (0.5 \times 1) = 0.5.
\end{align*}
Of course, $0.5$\ tails can never actually be observed in practice on one toss.
But it would be silly to round up (or down) and say that the expected number of tails on one toss of a coin is one (or zero).
The expected value of\ $0.5$ simply means that over a large number of repetitions of this random process, a tail is *expected* to occur in half of those repetitions.

as in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:NoMean).
The expected value of\ $Z$ is
$$
   \text{E}[Z] = \int_1^{-\infty} z \frac{1}{z^2}\, dz = \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{z} = -\log z \Big|_1^\infty.

However, $\displaystyle\lim_{z\to\infty}\, -\log z \to \infty$.
The expected value of $\text{E}[Z]$ is undefined.

## Expectation of a function of a random variable {#ExpectationFunction}

While the mean can be expressed in terms of mathematical expectation, mathematical expectation is a more general concept.

Let\ $X$ be a discrete random variable with a probability function $p_X(x)$, or a continuous random variable with pdf $f_X(x)$.
Also assume $g(X)$ is a real-valued function of\ $X$.
We can then define the expected value of $g(X)$.


:::{.definition #ExpectationFunction name="Expectation for function of a random variable"}
The *expected value* of some function $g(\cdot)$ of a random variable\ $X$ is written $\text{E}[ g(X)]$.

For a *discrete* random variable\ $X$ wth pmf $p_X(x)$, the expected value of $g(X)$ is
$$
   \text{E}\big[g(X)\big)] = \sum_{x\in R_X} g(x) p_X(x).
$$
For a *continuous* random variable\ $X$ wth pdf $f_X(x)$, the expected value of $g(X)$ is
$$
   \text{E}\big[g(X)\big] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x) f_X(x)\,dx.
$$
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationDiscreteFnX name="Expectation for a function of a discrete variable"}
Consider the discrete random variable\ $U$ with probability function shown in Example\ \@ref(exm:ExpectationDiscrete):
$$
   p_U(u) = \begin{cases}
               (u^2 + 1)/5 & \text{for $u = -1, 0, 1$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere}.
           \end{cases}
$$
Since $R_U = \{-1, 0, 1\}$, then $R_V = \{ (-1)^2, 0^2, 1^2\} = \{0, 1\}$.
Then expected value of $V = U^2$, where $g(U) = U^2$, is
\begin{align*}
   \text{E}[V] = \text{E}[g(U)]
   &= \sum_{R_U} g(u) p_U(u) \\
   &= \left( (-1)^2 \times \frac{(-1)^2 + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 0^2 \times \frac{(0)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) +
       \left( 1^2 \times \frac{(1)^2  + 1}{5} \right ) \\
   &= 2/5 + 0 + 2/5 = 4/5.
\end{align*}
The expected value of $V = U^2$ is\ $\text{E}[V] = 4/5$.
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationContinuousXFnX name="Expectation for a function of a continuous variable"}
Consider the continuous random variable\ $X$ with probability density function shown in Example\ \@ref(exm:ExpectationContinuousX):
$$
   f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
               x/4 & \text{for $1 < x < 3$};\\
               0 & \text{elsewhere}.
            \end{cases}
$$
The expected value of $Y = \sqrt{X}$, where $g(X) = \sqrt{X}$, is
\begin{align*}
   \text{E}[Y] = \text{E}[ g(X) ]
   &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x) f_X(x) \, dx\\
   &= \int_1^3 \sqrt{x}\times \frac{x}{4}\, dx\\
   &= \frac{9\sqrt{3} - 1}{10}\approx 1.458...
\end{align*}
The expected value of $Y = \sqrt{X}$ is $\text{E}[Y] = (9\sqrt{3} - 1)/10$.
:::





Importantly, the expectation operator is a *linear operator*, as stated below.


:::{.theorem #ExpectationLinear name="Expectation properties"}
For any random variable\ $X$ and constants\ $a$ and\ $b$,
$$
   \text{E}[aX + b] = a\text{E}[X] + b.
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Assume\ $X$ is a discrete random variable with probability function $p_X(x)$.
By Def.\ \@ref(def:ExpectationFunction) with $g(X) = aX + b$,
$$
   \text{E}[aX + b] = \sum_x (ax + b) p_X(x) = a\sum_x p_X(x) + \sum_x b p_X(x) = a\text{E}[X] + b,
$$
using that $\sum_x p_X(x) = 1$.
(The proof in the continuous case is similar, but the probability function is a pdf and integrals replace summations.)
:::


:::{.example #ExpectationFunctionY name="Expectation of a function of a random variable"}
Consider the random variable $Z = 2X$ where\ $X$ is defined in Example\ \@ref(exm:ExpectationContinuousX).
Using Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpectationLinear) with $a = 2$ and $b = 0$, the value of $\text{E}[Z]$ is
$$
      \text{E}[Z] = \text{E}[2X] = 2\text{E}[X] = 2 \times 13/6 = 13/3.
$$

## The variance and standard deviation {#VarianceStdDev}

Apart from the mean, the most important description of a random variable is the *variability*: quantifying how the values of the random variable are dispersed.
The most important measure of variability is the *variance*.

The variance is a measure of the variability of a random variable.
A small variance means the observations are nearly the same (i.e., small variation); a large variance means they are quite different.

The *variance* can be expressed as a function of a random variable.
(More correctly, we should say "the variance of the *distribution* of the random variable", but our language is very common.)


:::{.definition #Variance name="Variance"}
The *variance* of a random variable\ $X$ (or, of the distribution of\ $X$) is
$$
   \text{var}[X]  = \text{E}\big[(X - \mu)^2\big]
$$
where $\mu = \text{E}[X]$.
The variance of\ $X$ is commonly denoted by\ $\sigma^2$, or\ $\sigma^2_X$ if distinguishing among variables is needed.
:::


The variance is the *expected value* of the squared distance of the values of the random variable from the mean, weighted by the probability function.
The unit of measurement for variance is the original unit of measurement *squared*.
That is, if\ $X$ is measured in metres, the variance of\ $X$ is in $\text{metres}^2$.

Describing the variability in terms of the original units is more natural, by taking the square root of the variance.


:::{.definition #StandardDeviation name="Standard deviation"}
The *standard deviation* of a random variable\ $X$ is defined as the *positive* square root of the variance (denoted by\ $\sigma$); i.e.,
$$
   \text{sd}[X] = \sigma = +\sqrt{\text{var}[X]}
$$
:::

The variance is less popular than the standard deviation in practice to describe variability.
In theoretical work, however, the variance is easier to work with than standard deviation (due to the square root), and the variance, rather than standard deviation, features in many results in theoretical statistics.


:::{.example #VarianceDice name="Variance for a die toss"}
Suppose a fair die is tossed, and\ $X$ denotes the number of points showing. 
Then $\Pr(X = x) =  1/6$ for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ and
$$
   \mu = \text{E}[X] = \sum_S x\Pr(X = x) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 )/6 = 7/2.
$$
The variance of\ $X$ is then  
\begin{align*}
   \sigma^2 
   &= \text{var}[X] = \sum (X - \mu)^2 \Pr(X = x)\\
   &= \frac{1}{6}\left[ \left(1 - \frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + \left(2 - \frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + \dots + \left(6 - \frac{7}{2}\right)^2 \right] = \frac{70}{24}.
\end{align*}
The standard deviation is then $\sigma = \sqrt{70/24} = 1.71$.
:::


An important result is the  *computational formula for variance*.


:::{.theorem #VarianceComputational name="Computational formula for variance"}
For any random variable\ $X$,
$$
   \text{var}[X] = \text{E}[X^2] - (\text{E}[X])^2.
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $\text{E}[X] = \mu$, then (using the properties of expectation in Theorem\ \@ref(thm:ExpectationLinear)):  
\begin{align*}
\text{var}[X]
   = \text{E}\left[(X - \mu)^2\right]
   &= \text{E}[X^2 - 2X\mu + \mu^2] \\
   &= \text{E}[X^2] - \text{E}[2X\mu] + \text{E}[\mu^2]\quad\text{(since $\text{E}[\cdot]$ is a linear operator)}\\
   &= \text{E}[X^2] - 2\mu\text{E}[X] + \mu^2\\
   &= \text{E}[X^2] - 2\mu^2 + \mu^2 \\
   &= \text{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 \\
   &= \text{E}[X^2] - \big(\text{E}[X]\big)^2.
\end{align*}
:::


This formula is often easier to use to compute $\text{var}[X]$ than using the definition directly.


:::{.example #VarianceDice2 name="Variance for a die toss"}
Consider Example\ \@ref(exm:VarianceDice) again.
Then  
\begin{align*}
  \text{E}(X^2) = \sum_S x^2 \Pr(X = x) 
  &= \frac{1}{6}[1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 + 6^2]\\
  &= 91/6,
\end{align*}
and so $\text{var}(X) = 91/6 - (7/2)^2 = 70/24$, as before.
:::



:::{.example #VarianceComputational name="Variance using computational formula"}
Consider the continuous random variable\ $X$ with pdf
$$
   f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
            3x(2 - x)/4  & \text{for $0 < x < 2$};\\
            0 & \text{elsewhere}.
            \end{cases}
$$
The variance of\ $X$ can be computed in two ways: using $\text{var}[X] = \text{E}[(X - \mu)^2]$ or using the computational formula.
The expected value of $X$ is
$$
   \text{E}[X] = \int_0^2 x.3x(2 - x)4\, dx = 1.
$$
To use the computational formula, also find
$$
   \text{E}[X^2] = \frac{6}{5},
$$
and so $\text{var}[X] = \text{E}[X^2] - \big(\text{E}[X]\big)^2 = 1/5$.

Using the definition,  
\begin{align*}
   \text{var}[X]
   = \text{E}\big[(X - \text{E}(X))^2\big]
   &= \text{E}\big[(X - 1)^2\big]\\
   &= \int_0^2 (x - 1)^2 3x(2 - x)/4\,dx = 1/5.
\end{align*}

Both methods give the same answer of course, and both methods require initial computation of $\text{E}(X)$.
The computational formula requires less work.
:::


The variance represents the expected value of the squared distance of the values of the random variable from the mean.
The variance is never negative, and is only zero when all the values of the random variable are identical (that is, there *is* no variation).

If most of the probability lies near the mean, the dispersion will be small; if the probability is spread out over a considerable range the dispersion will be large.


:::{.example #InfiniteVar name="Infinite variance"}
In Example\ \@ref(exm:InfiniteMean), $\text{E}[X]$ was not defined.
For that reason, the variance is also undefined, since computing the variance relies on having a finite value for $\text{E}[X]$.
:::


:::{.theorem #VarianceLinear name="Variance properties"}
For any random variable\ $X$ and constants\ $a$ and\ $b$,
$$
   \text{var}[aX + b] = a^2\text{var}[X].
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Using the computational formula for the variance:  
\begin{align*}
   \text{var}[aX + b] 
   &= \text{E}[ (aX + b)^2 ] - \left[\text{E}[aX + b] \right] ^2\\
   &= \text{E}[a^2 X + 2abX + b^2] + (a\mu+b)^2\\
   &= a^2 \text{E}[X^2] - a^2\mu^2\\
   &= a^2 \text{var}[X].
\end{align*}
:::


The special case $a = 0$ is instructive: $\text{var}[b] = 0$ when $b$\ is constant; that is, a constant has *zero* variation, as expected.


:::{.example #VarancenFunctionY name="Variance of a function of a random variable"}
Consider the random variable $Y = 4 - 2X$ where $\text{E}[X] = 1$ and $\text{var}[X] = 3$.
Then:
\begin{align*}
  \text{E}[Y]
  &= \text{E}[4 - 2X] = 4 - 2\times\text{E}[X] = 2;\\
  \text{var}[Y]
  &= \text{var}[4 - 2X] = (-2)^2\text{var}[X] = 12.
\end{align*}

## Higher moments {#HigherMoments}

### Raw and central moments {#RawCentralMoments}

The ideas of a mean and a variance can be generalised.
The mean is a special case of a 'raw moment', and the variance is a special case of a 'central moment'.


:::{.definition #RawMoments name="Raw moments"}
The *$r$th moment about the origin*, or *$r$th raw moment*, of a random variable\ $X$ (where\ $r$ is a positive integer) is denoted\ $\mu'_r$ and defined as $\mu'_r = \text{E}[X^r]$.

For a discrete random variable\ $X$, the $r$th\ moment about the origin is
$$
  \mu'_r = \text{E}[X^r] = \sum_X x^r p_X(x).
$$
For a continuous random variable\ $X$, the $r$th\ moment about the origin is
$$
   \mu'_r = \text{E}[X^r] =  \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^r f_X(x)
$$
:::


:::{.definition #CentralMoments name="Central moments"}
The *$r$th central moment*, or *$r$th moment about the mean* (where\ $r$ is a positive integer), is denoted\ $\mu_r$ and defined as $\mu_r = \text{E}[(X - \mu)^r]$.

For a discrete random variable\ $X$, the $r$th central moment is
$$
   \mu_r = \text{E}[(X - \mu)^r] = \sum_x (x - \mu)^r p_X(x).
$$
For a continuous random variable\ $X$, the $r$th central moment is
$$
   \mu_r = \text{E}\big[(X - \mu)^r\big] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^r f_X(x).
$$
:::


From these definitions:

* the mean $\mu'_1 = \mu$ is the *first raw moment*;
* $\mu'_2 = \text{E}(X^2)$ is the *second raw moment*; and
* the variance $\mu_2 = \sigma^2$ is the *second central moment*.



### Skewness {#Skewness}

\index{Skewness|(}
Higher moments also exist that describe other features of a random variable.
One important higher moment is related to skewness.


:::{.definition #Skewness name="Skewness"}
The *skewness* of a distribution is defined as\index{Skewness!definition}\index{Skewness}
$$
  \text{skewness} = \operatorname{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^3\right].
$$
In terms of central moments,
\begin{equation}
     \text{skewness} = \gamma_1 = \frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}}.
     (\#eq:Skewness)
\end{equation}
:::


Rather than using central moments themselves, using expressions unaffected by a linear transformation of the type $Y = aX + b$ (for constants\ $a$ and\ $b$) are convenient for assessing skewness.
The ratio $(\mu_r)^p / (\mu_p)^r$ is such an expression, and the simplest form is a function of $\mu^2_3/\mu_2^3$, as used in the definition of\ $\gamma_1$.

For a symmetric distribution, the odd central moments are zero (Exercise\ \@ref(exr:SkewDiscreteCentralMomentsZero)).
This suggests that the odd central moments can be used to measure the *asymmetry* of a distribution (as in Def.\ \@ref(def:Skewness)).

If $\gamma_1 > 0$ we say the distribution is positively (or right) skewed,\index{Skewness!positive} and it is 'stretched' in the positive (negative) direction.
Similarly, if $\gamma_1 < 0$ we say the distribution is negatively (or left) skewed.\index{Skewness!negative}


:::{.definition #Symmetry name="Symmetry"}
The distribution of\ $X$ is said to be *symmetric*\index{Skewness!symmetric} if, for all $x\in R_X$,

* $\Pr(X = \mu + x) = \Pr(X = \mu - x)$ for the discrete case;
* $\Pr(X = \mu + x) = f_X(\mu - x)$ for the continuous case.
:::


For a symmetric distribution, the mean is also a median of the distribution, as these results show.

Consider the random variable\ $X$ in Example\ \@ref(exm:VarianceComputational), where $f_X(x) = x(2 - x)$ for $0 < x < 2$.
From that example, $\text{E}[X] = \mu'_1 = 1$ and $\text{E}[X^2] = \mu_2 = 6/5$.
Then,
$$
   \mu_3 = \int_0^2 (x - 1)^3 3x(2 - x)/4 \,dx = 0,
$$
so that the skewness in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:Skewness) will be zero.
This is expected, since the distribution is symmetric (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:VarianceComputationalPDF)).
:::

Then 
$$
   \mu'_1 = \text{E}(Y) = (5\times 0.2) + (6\times 0.3) + (7\times 0.5) = 6.3.

Likewise,

Hence, the skewness is

so the distribution has positive skewness.

### Kurtosis {#Kurtosis}

\index{Kurtosis|(}
Another ratio gives a measure of *kurtosis*, which measures the heaviness of the tails in a distribution; that is, how much of the probability of the random variable\ $X$ is concentrated in the extremes values of\ $X$.


:::{.definition #Kurtosis name="Kurtosis"}
The *kurtosis*\index{Kurtosis}\index{Kurtosis!definition} of a random variable\ $X$ with a given probability function is defined as
$$
  \text{kurtosis} = \operatorname{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^4\right].
$$
In terms of central moments,
\begin{equation*}
     \text{kurtosis} = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu^2_2}.
\end{equation*}
The *excess kurtosis*\index{Kurtosis!excess} of a distribution is defined as  
\begin{equation*}
     \gamma_2 = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu^2_2} - 3.
\end{equation*}
The *excess kurtosis* definition defines the excess kurtosis compared to a bell-shaped (normal distribution),\index{Normal distribution!kurtosis} which has an excess kurtosis of zero.
:::


:::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Excess kurtosis is so commonly used that is often just called 'kurtosis'.
:::


One way to understand kurtosis (from @moors1986meaning) is to first define $Z = (X - \mu)/sigma$; then the kurtosis is, from Def.\ \@ref(def:Kurtosis), $\operatorname{E}[Z^4]$, and $\operatorname{E}[Z] = 0$ and $\operatorname{var}[X] = 1$.
Also observe that since $\operatorname{var}[X] =  \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \operatorname{E}[X]^2$ (the definition of variance), we can write
\begin{equation}
   \operatorname{E}[X^2] = \operatorname{var}[X] + \operatorname{E}[X]^2.
   (\#eq:VarianceRearranged)
\end{equation}

Then, the kurtosis is
\begin{align*}
  \operatorname{E}[Z^4]
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + \operatorname{E}[Z^2]^2\quad\text{(using Eq.~(\ref{eq:VarianceRearranged}))}\\
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + 
     \left\{ \operatorname{var}[Z] + \operatorname{E}[Z]^2\right\}^2\quad\text{(using Eq.~(\ref{eq:VarianceRearranged}) again)}\\
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + (1 + 0)^2 \\
  &= \operatorname{var}[Z^2] + 1.
\end{align*}
Thus, the kurtosis is related to the variance of\ $Z^2$ about the mean.
AND SO WHAT???

Large values of kurtosis corresponds to greater proportion of the distribution in the tails.
The *excess kurtosis* is defined so that the normal, or bell-shaped, distribution (Sect.\ \@ref(Normal)), which has a kurtosis of\ $3$, has a excess kurtosis of zero.
Then (see Fig.\ \@ref(fig:KurtosisPlots)):

* distributions with *negative* excess kurtosis are called *platykurtic*.\index{Playtkurtic}
  These distribution have fewer, or less extreme, observations in the tail compared to the normal distribution ('thinner tails').
  Examples include the Bernoulli distribution (Sect.\ \@ref(BernoulliTrials)).
* distributions with *positive* excess kurtosis are called *leptokurtic*.\index{Leptokurtic}
  These distribution have more, or more extreme, observations in the tail compared to the normal distribution ('fatter tails').
  Examples include the exponential distribution (Sect.\ \@ref(ExponentialDistribution)) and Poisson distributions (Sect.\ \@ref(PoissonDistribution)).
* distributions with *zero* excess kurtosis are called *mesokurtic*.\index{Mesokurtic}
  The normal distribution (Sect.\ \@ref(Normal))\index{Normal distribution} is the obvious example.

Consider the discrete random variable $U$ from Example\ \@ref(exm:ExpectationDiscrete).

   &= \sum_{u = -1, 0, 1} u^r \frac{u^2 + 1}{5} \\
   &= (-1)^r \frac{ (-1)^2 + 1}{5} +
       (0)^r \frac{ (0)^2 + 1}{5} +

   &= \frac{2(-1)^r}{5} + 0 + \frac{2}{5} \\
   &= \frac{2}{5}[ (-1)^r + 1]

for the $r$th raw moment.
Then,
\begin{align*}

   \text{E}(X^4) &= \mu'_2 = \frac{2}{5}[ (-1)^4 + 1 ] = 4/5.
\end{align*}
Since $\text{E}(U) = 0$, then the $r$th central and raw moments are the same: $\mu'_r = \mu_r$.
Notice that once the initial computations to find $\mu'_r$ are complete, the evaluation of any raw moment is simple.

The skewness is
$$
   \gamma_1 = \frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}} = \frac{0}{(4/5)^{3/2}} = 0, 
$$
so the distribution is symmetric.
The excess kurtosis is
$$
   \gamma_2 = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2^2} -3 = \frac{4/5}{(4/5)^2} -3 = -7/4, 
$$
so the distribution is platykurtic.

## Moment-generating functions {#MGF}


### Introduction {#MGFIntroduction}


By themselves, the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis do not completely describe a distribution (all the distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:KurtosisPlots) have mean\ $0$, variance\ $1$ and skewness\ $0$, for instance); many different distributions can be found having a given mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis.
However, in general, *all* the moments of a distribution together define the distribution.
This leads to the idea of a *moment-generating function*.

Suppose I asked you to draw the probability density function of a random variable\ $X$, with $\text{E}[X] = 2$.
Any of the six distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixDistributions) meet this criterion (based on the first moment), so this information is not sufficient to uniquely define a distribution.

So, suppose add a extra criterion: in addition, we require $\text{var}[X] = 1$.
Any of the first five distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixDistributions) meet these two criteria (based on the first two moments), so again this information is not sufficient to uniquely define a distribution.

Suppose a third criterion is added: the distribution must be symmetric.
Any of the first four distributions in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixDistributions) meet these three criteria (based on the first three moments); again, this information is not sufficient to uniquely define a distribution.

In general, *all* the moments of a distribution are needed to uniquely define a distribution.
All the moments of a distribution can be succinctly captured in a *moment generating function* (or MGF).\index{Moment generating function}

### Definition {#MGFDefinition}

So far, the distribution of a random variable has been described using a probability function or a distribution function.
Sometimes, however, working with a different representation is useful (for example, see Sect.\ \@ref(TransformationMoments)).

In this section, the *moment-generating function* is used to represent the distribution of the probabilities of a random variable.
As the name suggests, this function can be used to generate *any* moment of a distribution.
Other uses of the moment-generating function are seen later (see Sect.\ \@ref(TransformationMoments)).


:::{.definition #MGF name="Moment-generating function (mgf)"}
The *moment-generating function* (or mgf) $M_X(t)$ of the random variable\ $X$ define over a range\ $R_X$ is denoted $M_X(t)$, and defined as 
$$
   \text{E}\big[\exp(tX)\big], 
$$
provided the expectation exists for values of\ $t$ in some interval that includes $t = 0$.

When\ $X$ is a discrete random variable,
$$
  M_X(t)  = \text{E}\big[\exp(tX)\big] = \sum_{x\in R_X} \exp(tx) p_X(x).
$$
When\ $X$ is a continuous random variable,
$$
  M_X(t)  = \text{E}\big[\exp(tX)\big] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(tx) f_X(x).
$$
:::

The mgf is defined as an infinite series or an infinite integral.
Such an expression may not always exist (that is, converge to a finite value) for all values of $t$, so the mgf may not be defined for all values of\ $t$.
Note that the mgf always exists for $t = 0$; in fact $M_X(0) = 1$.

Provided the mgf is defined for some values of $t$ *other* than zero, it *uniquely* defines a probability distribution, and we can use it to easily generate the moments of the distribution, as described in Theorem\ \@ref(thm:Moments).


::: {.linkBox .link data-latex="{iconmonstr-link-1-240.png}"}
Moment-generating functions are related to Laplace transformations.
:::

:::{.example #MGF name="Moment-generating function"}
Consider the random variable\ $Y$ with pdf
$$
   f_Y(y) =
   \begin{cases}
      \exp(-y) & \text{for $y > 0$};\\
      0        & \text{elsewhere.}
   \end{cases}
$$
The mgf is
\begin{align*}
   M_Y(t)
    = \text{E}[\exp(tY)] 
   &= \int_0^\infty \exp(ty)\exp(-y)\, dy \\
   &= \int_0^\infty \exp\{ y(t-1) \}\, dy \\
   &= \left.\frac{1}{t-1} \exp\{y(t-1)\}\right|_{y = 0}^{y = \infty}\\
   &= (1 - t)^{-1}
\end{align*}
provided $t - 1 < 0$; that is, for $t < 1$.
If $t > 1$, the integral does not converge. 
For example, if $t = 2$,
$$
   \left. \frac{1}{2 - 1} \exp(y)\right|_{y = 0}^{y = \infty} = \exp(0) - \lim_{y\to\infty} \exp(y)
$$
which does not converge.
:::



:::{.example #MGFDice name="Mgf for die rolls"}
Consider the pmf of\ $X$, the outcome of tossing a fair die (Example\ \@ref(exm:VarianceDice)).
The mgf of\ $X$ is
\begin{align*}
   M_X(t)
   &= \text{E}(\exp(tX)) = \sum_{x = 1}^6 \exp(tx) p_X(x)\\
   &= \frac{1}{6}\left(e^t + e^{2t} + e^{3t} + e^{4t} + e^{5t} + e^{6t}\right),
\end{align*}
which exists for all values of\ $t$.
:::


### Using the mgf to generate moments {#MGFMoments}

Replacing $\exp(xt)$ by its series expansion (App.\ \@ref(UsefulSeries)) in the definition of the mgf gives  
\begin{align*}
     M_X(t) 
     & = {\sum_x} \left(1 + xt + \frac{x^2t^2}{2!} + \dots\right) \Pr(X = x)\\
     & = 1 + \mu'_1t + \mu'_2 \frac{t^2}{2!} +\mu'_3 \frac{t^3}{3!} + \dots
\end{align*}
Then,  the $r$th moment of a distribution about the origin is seen to be the coefficient of $t^r/r!$ in the series expansion of $M_X(t)$:  
\begin{align*}
     \frac{d M_X(t)}{dt} 
     & = \sum_x x\,e^{xt}\Pr(X = x)\\
     \frac{d^2 M_X(t)}{dt^2} 
     & = \sum_x x^2\,e^{xt} \Pr(X = x),
\end{align*}
and, in general, for each positive integer\ $r$:
$$
   \frac{d^r M_X(t)}{dt^r} = \sum_x x^re^{xt}\Pr(X = x). 
$$
On setting $t = 0$, 
\begin{align*}
 \left.\frac{d M_X(t)}{dt}\right|_{t = 0} &= \text{E}[X]\\
 \left.\frac{d^2M_X(t)}{dt^2}\right|_{t = 0} &= \text{E}[X^2].
\end{align*}
(The notation means to evaluate the expression at $t = 0$.)
In general, for each positive integer\ $r$,  
\begin{equation}
  \left.\frac{d^r M_X(t)}{dt^r}\right|_{t = 0} = \text{E}(X^r).
\end{equation}
(Sometimes, $d^r M_X(t)/dt^r$ evaluated at $t = 0$ is written as $M^{(r)}(0)$ for brevity.)
This result is summarised in the following theorem.


:::{.theorem #Moments name="Moments"}
The $r$th moment\ $\mu'_r$ of the distribution of the random variable\ $X$ about the origin is given by either

1. the coefficient of $t^r/r!,  r = 1, 2, 3,\dots$ in the power series expansion of $M_X(t)$; or
2. $\displaystyle \mu'_r = \left.\frac{d^rM(t)}{dt^r}\right|_{t = 0}$ where $M_X(t)$ is the mgf of $X$.
:::


:::{.example #MeanVarMGF name="Mean and variance from a MGF"}
Continuing Example\ \@ref(exm:MGF), the mean and variance of\ $Y$ can be found from the mgf.
To find the mean, first find
$$
   \frac{d}{dt}M_Y(t) = (1 - t)^{-2}.
$$
Setting $t = 0$ gives the mean as $\text{E}[Y] = 1$. 
Likewise,
$$
   \frac{d^2}{dt^2}M_Y(t) = 2(1 - t)^{-3}.
$$
Setting $t = 0$ gives $\text{E}[Y^2] = 2$.
The variance is therefore $\text{var}[Y] = 2 - 1^2 = 1$.

Once the moment-generating function has been computed, raw moments can be computed using
$$
   \text{E}[Y^r)] = \mu'_r = \left.\frac{d^r}{dt^r} M_Y(t)\right|_{t = 0}.
$$
:::



### Some useful results

The moment-generating function can be used to derive the distribution of a function of a random variable (see Sect.\ \@ref(TransformationMoments)).
The following theorems are valuable for this task.


:::{.theorem #MGFLinear name="Mgf of linear combinations"}
If the random variable\ $X$ has mgf $M_X(t)$ and $Y = aX + b$ where\ $a$ and\ $b$ are constants, then the mgf of\ $Y$ is
$$
   M_Y(t) = \operatorname{E}\big[\exp\{t(aX + b)\}\big] = \exp(bt) M_X(at).
$$
:::



:::{.theorem #MGFIndependent name="Mgf of independent rvs"}
If $X_1$, $X_2$, $\dots$, $X_n$ are $n$ independent random variables, where\ $X_i$ has mgf $M_{X_i}(t)$, then the mgf of $Y = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots X_n$ is
$$
   M_Y(t) = \prod_{i = 1}^n M_{X_i}(t).
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
The proofs are left as an exercise.
:::


Note that in the special case when all the random variables are independently and identically distributed in Theorem\ \@ref(thm:MGFLinear), we have
$$
   M_Y(t) = [M_{X_i}(t)]^n.
$$


:::{.example #MGFLinearCombinations name="Mgf of linear combinations"}
Consider the random variable\ $X$ with pf
$$
   p_X(x) = 2(1/3)^x \qquad \text{for $x = 1, 2, 3, \dots$}
$$
and zero elsewhere.
The mgf of\ $X$ is
\begin{align*}
   M_X(t)
   &= \sum_{x: p(x) > 0} \exp(tx) p_X(x) \\
   &= \sum_{x = 1}^\infty \exp(tx) 2(1/3)^x \\
   &= 2\sum_{x = 1}^\infty (\exp(t)/3)^x \\
   &= 2\left\{ \frac{\exp(t)}{3} + \left(\frac{\exp(t)}{3}\right)^2
   + \left(\frac{\exp(t)}{3}\right)^3 + \dots\right\} \\
   &= \frac{2\exp(t)}{3 - \exp(t)}
\end{align*}
where $\sum_{y = 1}^\infty a^y = a/(1 - a)$ for $a < 1$ has been used (App.\ \@ref(UsefulSeries)); here $a = \exp(t)/3$.

Next consider finding the mgf of $Y = (X - 2)/3$.
From Theorem\ \@ref(thm:MGFLinear) with $a = 1/3$ and $b = -2/3$,
$$
   M_Y(t) 
   = \exp(-2t/3) M_X(t/3)
   = \frac{2\exp\{(-t)/3\}}{3 - \exp(t/3)}.
$$
In practice, rather than identify\ $a$ and\ $b$ and remember Theorem\ \@ref(thm:MGFLinear), problems like this are best solved directly from the definition of the mgf:
\begin{align*}
   M_Y(t) 
    = \text{E}(\exp(tY))
   &= \text{E}(\exp\{t(X - 2)/3\})\\
   &= \text{E}(\exp\{tX/3 - 2t/3\})\\
   &= \exp(-2t/3) M_X(t/3) \\
   &= \frac{2\exp\{(-t)/3\}}{3 - \exp(t/3)}.
\end{align*}
:::


### Determining the distribution from the mgf {#DistributionFromMGF}

The mgf (if it exists) completely determines the distribution of a random variable hence, given a mgf, deducing the probability function should be possible.
For some distributions, the pdf cannot be written in closed form (so the pdf can *only* be evaluated numerically), but the mgf is relatively simple to write down.

In the **discrete case**, the mgf is defined as  
\begin{equation}
   M_X(t)  
   = \operatorname{E}[\exp(tX)] 
   = \sum_X e^{tx} p_X(x)
   (\#eq:MGFtoPDFdiscrete)
\end{equation}
for\ $X$ discrete with pmf $p_X(x)$.
This can be expressed as  
\begin{align*}
   M_X(t)
   &= \exp(t x_1) p_X(x_1) + \exp(t x_2)p_X(x_2) + \dots\\
   &= \exp(t x_1) \Pr(X = x_1) + \exp(t x_2)\Pr(X = x_2) + \dots\\
\end{align*}
and so the probability function of\ $Y$ can be deduced from the mgf.


:::{.example #DistFromMGF name="Distribution from the mgf"}
Suppose a discrete random variable\ $D$ has the mgf
$$
   M_D(t) = \frac{1}{3} \exp(2t) + \frac{1}{6}\exp(3t) + \frac{1}{12}\exp(6t)
   + \frac{5}{12}\exp(7t).
$$
Then, by the definition of the mgf in the discrete case given above, the coefficient of\ $t$ in the exponential indicates values of\ $D$, and the coefficient indicates the probability of that value of\ $Y$:  
\begin{align*}
   M_D(t)
   &= \overbrace{\frac{1}{3} \exp(2t)}^{D = 2} + \overbrace{\frac{1}{6}\exp(3t)}^{D = 3} +
       \overbrace{\frac{1}{12}\exp(6t)}^{D = 6} + \overbrace{\frac{5}{12}\exp(7t)}^{D = 7}\\
   &= \Pr(D = 2)\exp(2t) + \Pr(D = 3)\exp(3t) + \\
   & \quad \Pr(D = 6)\exp(6t) + \Pr(D = 7)\exp(7t).
\end{align*}
So the pmf is
$$
   p_D(d) =
   \begin{cases}
      1/3 & \text{for $d=2$}\\
      1/6 & \text{for $d=3$}\\
      1/12 & \text{for $d=6$}\\
      5/12 & \text{for $d=7$}\\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
$$
(Of course, it is easy to check by computing the mgf for\ $D$ from the pf found above; you should get the original mgf.)
:::


Sometimes, using the results in App.\ \@ref(UsefulSeries) can be helpful.


:::{.example #DistFromMGF2 name="Distribution from the mgf"}
Consider the mgf
$$
   M_X(t) = \frac{\exp(t)}{3 - 2\exp(t)}.
$$
To find the corresponding probability function, one approach is to write the mgf as
$$
   M_X(t) = \frac{\exp(t)/3}{1 - 2\exp(t)/3}.
$$
This is the sum of a geometric series (Eq.\ \@ref(eq:SumGeometricInfinite)):
$$
   a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n - 1}
   \rightarrow \frac{a}{1 - r} \text{ as $n  \rightarrow  \infty$},
$$
where $a = \exp(t)/3$ and $r = 2\exp(t)/3$.
Hence the mgf can be expressed as
$$
   \frac{1}{3}\exp(t) + 
   \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \exp(2t) + 
   \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 \exp(3t) + \dots
$$
so that the probability function can be deduced as
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(X = 1) &= \frac{1}{3};\\
   \Pr(X = 2) &= \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right);\\
   \Pr(X = 3) &= \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2,
\end{align*}
or, in general,
$$
   p_x(x) = \frac{1}{3}\left( \frac{2}{3}\right)^{x - 1}\quad\text{for $x = 1, 2, 3, \dots$}.
$$
(Later, this will be identified as a [geometric distribution](#GeometricDistribution).)\index{Geometric distribution}
:::


The case of a **continuous random variable** is more involved.
Suppose the continuous random variable\ $X$ has the mgf $M_X(t)$.
Then the probability density function is (see @abramowitz1964handbook, \S26.1.10)
\begin{equation}
   f_X(x) = 
   \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} M_X(it) \exp(-itx)\, dt,
   (\#eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous)
\end{equation}
where $i = \sqrt{-1}$.


:::{.example #DistFromMGFContinuous name="Distribution from the mgf"}
Consider the mgf for a continuous random variable\ $X$ such that $M_X(t) = \exp(t^2/2)$, for $y\in\mathbb{R}$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
Then, $M_X(it) = \exp\left( (it)^2/2 \right) = \exp(-t^2/2)$. 
Using Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous), the pdf is:
\begin{align*}
 f_X(x) 
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-t^2/2) \exp(-itx)\, dt,\\
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-t^2/2)\left[ \cos(-tx) + i\sin(-itx)\right]\, dt,
\end{align*}
since $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
Extracting just the real components:
\begin{align*}
 f_X(x) 
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-t^2/2) \cos(-tx) \, dt\\
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \left( \sqrt{2\pi} \exp( -x^2/2 ) \right)
  = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi} } \exp( -x^2/2 ),
\end{align*}
which will later be identified as a [normal distribution](#StandardNormal)\index{Normal distribution} with a mean of zero, and standard deviation of one.
:::


In practice, using Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) can become tedious or intractable for producing a closed form expression for the pdf.
However, Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) has been used to compute numerical values of the probability density function.
For example, @mypapers:Dunn:fourier used Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) to evaluate the *Tweedie distributions*\index{Tweedie distribution} [@mypapers:DunnSmyth:IWSM:2001], for which (in general) the pdf has no closed form, but does have a simple mgf.


## Tchebysheff's inequality {#Tchebysheff}

Tchebysheff's inequality applies to any probability distribution, and is sometimes useful in theoretical work or to provide bounds on probabilities.


:::{.theorem #Tchebysheff name="Tchebysheff's theorem"}
Let\ $X$ be a random variable with finite mean\ $\mu$ and variance\ $\sigma^2$.
Then for any positive\ $k$,
\begin{equation}
   \Pr\big(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma \big)\leq \frac{1}{k^2}
   (\#eq:Tchebysheff)
\end{equation}
or, equivalently  
\begin{equation}
   \Pr\big(|X - \mu| < k\sigma \big)\geq 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}.
\end{equation}
:::

:::{.proof}
The proof for the continuous case only is given.
Let\ $X$ be continuous with pdf\ $f(x)$.
For some $c > 0$, then  
\begin{align*}
     \sigma^2 
     & = \int^\infty_{-\infty} (x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx\\
     & = \int^{\mu -\sqrt{c}}_{-\infty} (x - \mu )^2f(x)\, dx +
         \int^{\mu + \sqrt{c}}_{\mu-\sqrt{c}}(x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx +
         \int^\infty_{\mu + \sqrt{c}}(x - \mu)^2f(x)\,dx\\
     & \geq \int^{\mu -\sqrt{c}}_{-\infty} (x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx + 
       \int^\infty_{\mu + \sqrt{c}}(x - \mu )^2f(x)\,dx,
\end{align*}
since the second integral is non-negative.
Now $(x - \mu )^2 \geq c$ if $x \leq \mu -\sqrt{c}$ or $x\geq \mu + \sqrt{c}$.
So in both the remaining integrals above, replace $(x - \mu )^2$ by $c$ without altering the direction of the inequality:
\begin{align*}
  \sigma^2 
  &\geq  c \int^{\mu -\sqrt{c}}_{-\infty} f(x)\,dx + c\int^\infty_{\mu + \sqrt{c}}f(x)\,dx\\
  &=  c\,\Pr(X \leq \mu - \sqrt{c}\,) + c\,\Pr(X \geq \mu + \sqrt{c}\,)\\
  &=  c\,\Pr(|X - \mu| \geq \sqrt{c}\,).
\end{align*}
Putting $\sqrt{c} = k\sigma$, Eq.\ \@ref(eq:Tchebysheff) is obtained.
:::


With the probability function or pdf of a random variable\ $X$, then $\text{E}(X)$ and $\text{var}(X)$ can be found, but the converse is not true. 
That is, from a knowledge of $\text{E}(X)$ and $\text{var}(X)$ we cannot reconstruct the probability distribution of\ $X$ and hence cannot compute probabilities such as $\Pr(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma)$.
Nonetheless, using Tchebysheff's inequality we can find a useful *bound* to either the probability outside or inside of $\mu \pm k\sigma$.




## Exercises

Selected answers appear in Sect.\ \@ref(AnswersChap3).


:::{.exercise #MeanAbsDev}
We have already seen variance and standard deviation are suitable measures of dispersion.
Another alternative is the *mean absolute deviation* (MAD), defined as:

* $\displaystyle 
   \text{E}[|X - \mu|] 
      = \sum_x |x - \mu| p_X(x)$ for a discrete random variable\ $X$;
* $\displaystyle 
    \text{E}[|X - \mu|] 
      = 
         \int_{-\infty}^\infty |x - \mu| f_X(x)\,dx$ for a continuous random variable\ $X$.

Consider the fair die described in Example\ \@ref(exm:VarianceDice).
Then $\mu = \text{E}[X] = 7/2$ and thus the MAD of\ $X$ is  
\begin{align*}
   \text{E}[|X - \mu|] 
   &= \sum |x - \mu| \Pr(X = x)\\
   &= \frac{1}{6}\left[ \left|1 - \frac{7}{2}\right| +\left|2 - \frac{7}{2}\right| + \dots + \left|6 - \frac{7}{2}\right|\right]\\
   &= 1.5.
\end{align*}

Like the median, the MAD is difficult to use in theoretical work (due to the absolute value).
The most-used measure of dispersion is the variance (or standard deviation).

:::{.exercise}
A *mixture distribution* is a mixture of two or more univariate distributions.
For example, the heights of all adults may follow a mixture distribution: one normal distribution for adult females, and another for adult males.
For a set of probability functions $p^{(i)}_X(x)$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots n$ and a set of weights $w_i$ such that $\sum w_i = 1$ and $w_i \ge 0$ for all $i$, the mixture distribution $f_X(x)$ is
$$
   f_X(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i p^{(i)}_X(x).
$$

1. Compute the distribution function for $p_X(x)$.
1. Compute the mean and variance of $f_X(x)$.
1. Consider the case where $p^{(i)}_X(x)$ has a normal distribution for $i = 1, 2, 3$, where the means are $-1$, $2$, and $4$ respectively, and the variances are $1$, $1$ and $4$ respectively.
   Plot the probability density function of $f_X(x)$ for various instructive values of the weights.
1. Suppose heights of female adults have a normal distribution with mean $163$\ cm and a standard deviation of $5$\ cm, and adult males have heights with a mean of $175$\ cm with standard deviation of $7$\ cm, and constitute $48$\ % of the population [@data:ABS1995:MeasureUp].
   Deduce and plot the probability density of heights of adult Australians.

:::{.exercise #InvertMGFcontinuous}
In practice, some distributions cannot be written in closed form, but can be given by writing their moment-generating function. 
To evaluate the density then requires an infinite summation or an infinite integral. 
Given a moment-generating function $M(t)$, the probability density function can be reconstructed numerically from
the integral using the *inversion formula* in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous).

The evaluation of the integral generally requires advanced numerical techniques. 
In this question, we just consider the exponential distribution as a simple example to demonstrate the use of the inversion formula.

1. Write down the expression in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:MGFtoPDFcontinuous) in the case of the *exponential distribution*, for which $M_X(t) = \lambda/(\lambda - t)$ for $t < \lambda$. 
2. Only the real part of the integral is needed.
   Extract the real parts of this expression, and simplify the integrand. 
   (The integrand is the expression to be integrated.) 
3. Plot the integrand from the last part from $t = -50$ to $t = 2$ in the case $\lambda = 2$ and $x = 1$.

:::{.exercise #PooledTest2}
(This exercise follows from Ex.\ \@ref(exr:PooledTest).)
To detect disease in a population through a blood test, usually every individual is tested.
If the disease is uncommon, however, an alternative method is often more efficient.  

In the alternative method (called a *pooled test*), blood from $n$ individuals is combined, and one test is conducted.
If the test returns a negative result, then none of the $n$ people have the disease; if the test returns a positive result, all $n$ individuals are then tested individually to identify which individual(s) have the disease.

Suppose a disease occurs in an unknown proportion of people $p$ of people.
Let $X$ be the number of tests to be performed for a group of $n$ individuals.

1. What is the expected number of tests needed in a group of $n$ people using the pooled method?
1. What is the variance of the number of tests needed in a group of $n$ people using the pooled method?
1. Explain what happens to the mean and variance as $p \to 1$ and as $p \to 0$, and how these results make sense *in the context of the question*
1. If pooling was *not* used with a group of $n$ people, the number of tests would be $n$: one for each person.
   Deduce an expression for the value of $p$ for which the expected number of tests using the pooled approach *exceeds* the non-pooled approach.
1. Produce a well-labelled plot showing the expected number of tests that are *saved* by using the pooled method when $p = 0.1$ for values of $n$ from $2$ to $10$, and comment on what this shows practically.
1. Suppose a test costs \$$15$.
   What is the expected cost-saving for using the pooled-testing method with $n = 4$ and $p = 0.1$, if $200$ people must be tested?
