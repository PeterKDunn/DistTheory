## Random variables {#RandomVariables}

Chap. \@ref(Probability) introduced the language and tools of probability to describe uncertainty.
The concept of the [*sample space*](#def:SampleSpace) was introduced, which describes the possible outcomes of a [*random process*](#def:Process).
Often, however, the elements of the sample space are not of direct interest, especially if the sample space is large or infinite.
Subsets of these sample space elements are usually of greater interest and more convenient to work with.

For example, the sample space for the observing the rolls of two dice (Example \@ref(exm:TwoDice)) contains 36 elements.
We may be interested in the *sum* of the two rolls anyway, rather than which elements in the sample space gave rise to the sum.
That is, we may be more interested in *whether* we roll a sum of 5 than *how* that sum of 5 was obtained.
We can 'collect' various elements of the sample space together and treat them as a collective of what we are interested in.

More generally, collecting elements of the sample space together is useful, and we can assign a real number to that collection.
This leads to the idea of a *random variable*.


:::{.definition #RandomVariable name="Random variable"}
A *random variable* is some function that assigns a real number (say, $X(s)$) to each outcome $s$ in the sample space $S$.
Often, $X(s)$ is just written as $X$.
:::


Since $X$ is a function, every $s\in S$ is assigned to exactly one value $X(s)$.
The converse is not true: many values of $s\in S$ may be assigned to the same value of $X(s)$.
*Random variable* may be abbreviated to rv.


:::{.definition #DomainRange name="Domain and range space"}
The *domain* (i.e., inputs) of a random variable is the sample space, and the *range space* or *value set* is the set of real numbers taken by function.

The *range space* for a random variable $X$ is often denoted $R_X$.
:::


The domain of $X$ is the set $S$ and the range space is the set $\{X(s)\mid s\in S\}$.
The variable is *random* since its value depends upon the outcome of the random process.

A capital letter (such as $Y$) is usually used to denote the *description* of the random variable, while lower-case letters (such as $y$) are used to describe the *values* that the random variable can take.
For example, writing $Y = 3$ means:

* 'The sum of the roll of two dice...' (that is, the description of the random variable $Y$)
* '...is equal to...' (that is, the ${} = {}$ sign)
* '... the value 3.' (that is, the specific *value* of the random variable, $3$).



:::{.example #TwoDiceRV name="Sum of two die rolls"}
Consider observing the rolls of two dice.
The sample space contains 36 elements (Example \@ref(exm:TwoDice)), and could be denoted as $(r_1, r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the results of roll 1 and 2 respectively. 
The sample space is listed in Table \@ref(tab:TwoDice).
For example, we could define $s_1$ as the sample point $(1, 1)$.

Then, we could define the random variable $Y$ on this sample space as:
\[
   Y(s)  = \text{the sum of the two rolls in $s$} = r_1 + r_2.
\]
In this way, every outcome in the sample space is assigned a real value:


**Sample space elements** | **Value of random variable**
--------------------------|----------------------------
(1, 1)                    |  2
(1, 2), (2, 1)            |  3
(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)    |  4
$\vdots$                  | $\vdots$
(6, 6)                    | 12


Then, for example, the elements of $S$ assigned to $Y = 4$ are
\[ 
   (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1).
\]
Notice that many elements of the sample space can be assigned to the same value of the random variable.

The domain in the sample space $S$, and the range space is $R_X = \{ Y(s) | s\in S\} = \{2, 3, \dots, 12\}$.
:::


:::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Random variables* are different than *variables* used in (for example) algebra.
In algebra, a "variable" is the value of an unknown quantity.
:::


:::{.example #DrawTwoCards name="Drawing two cards"}
Consider drawing two cards from a standard, well-shuffled pack of cards, and observing the colour of the card (B: Black; R: Red).
The sample space $\Omega$ is:
\[
   \Omega = \{ (BB), (BR), (RR), (RB)\}.
\]
Many random variables could be defined on this sample space; for example:
\begin{align*}
   T&: \text{The number of black cards drawn};\\
   M&: \text{The number of red cards drawn on the first draw};\\
   D&: \text{The number of black cards drawn,}\\
    &\quad \text{minus the number of red cards drawn}.
\end{align*}
All of these assign a real number to each element of $\Omega$.
The random variable $D$, for instance, is defined as:


**Sample space elements** | **Value of $D$**
--------------------------|-----------------
$(BR)$ and $(RB)$         | $D = 0$
$(BB)$                    | $D = 2$
$(RR)$                    | $D = -2$


The domain is $\Omega$, and the range space is $R_D = \{ D(s) | s\in S\} = \{-2, 0, 2\}$.
:::


:::{.example #TossCoinTillHead name="Tossing a coin till a head appears"}
Consider the random process 'tossing a coin until a Head is observed'.
The sample space is
\[
   \Omega = \{(H), (TH), (TTH), (TTTH), \dots \}.
\]
We could then define the random variable $N$ as 'the number of tosses until the first head is thrown'.
Then each element of the sample space can be assigned to a real number:
\begin{align*}
   (H)\quad&\text{is assigned to}\quad N = 1;\\
   (TH)\quad&\text{is assigned to}\quad N = 2;\\
   (TTH)\quad&\text{is assigned to}\quad N = 3;
\end{align*}
and so on.
Writing $N = 2$ means 'the number of tosses to observe the first head is two'.
:::





## Discrete, continuous and mixed random variables {#DiscreteContMixed}

Random variables can be discrete, continuous, or a mixture of both.


### Discrete random variables

:::{.definition #DiscreteRV name="Discrete random variable"}
A **discrete random variable** contains a finite, or countably infinite, number of values within any given interval of a given domain.
:::


:::{.example}
In Example \@ref(exm:TwoDiceRV), exactly 11 values of the random variable $Y$ are possible: $2, 3, \dots 12$.

In Example \@ref(exm:DrawTwoCards), the random variable $D$ can take one of three possible values: $-2, 0\text{ or }2$.

In Example \@ref(exm:TossCoinTillHead), the random variable $N$ takes a *countably infinite* number of possible values: $1, 2, 3, \dots$
:::


The definition refers to the values of random variable, not to the [sample space](#def:SDiscreteSampleSpace) (i.e., the inputs to the function).



### Continuous random variables

For a [continuous sample space](#def:ContinuousSampleSpace), the random variable is usually the *identity function* $Y(s) = s$.

For example, in Example \@ref(exm:ContinuousSampleSpaceThrow) the sample space that describes how far a cricket ball can be thrown is already defined on the positive reals.
Hence, we can define the random variable as $T(s) = s$, where $s$ is the distance specified in the sample space.


:::{.definition #ContinuousRF name="Continuous random variable"}
A **continuous random variable** can take on any value within any given interval of a given domain (at least in theory).
:::


The value of a continuous random variable can never, in principle, be measured exactly, so in practice needs to be rounded.


:::{.example #ContinuousRVHeight name="Heights"}
Height $H$ is often recorded to the nearest centimetre (e.g., 179cm) for convenience and practicality. 
Better measuring instruments may be able to record height to one or more decimal places of a centimetre.
The range space is $R_H = \{ H(s) \mid s \in (0, \infty)\}$.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Even though *your* height may not change, the notion of a *random variable* means that height varies from one realisation of the random process to another; that is, from one *person* to the next.
:::

Examples of continuous random variables include:

* The volume of waste water treated at a sewage plant per day.
* The weight of hearts in normal rats.
* The lengths of the wings of butterflies.
* The yield of barley from a large paddock.
* The amount of rainfall recorded each year.
* The time taken to perform a psychological test.



### Mixed random variables

Some random variables are not completely discrete or continuous; these are called *mixed random variables*.


::: {.definition #MixedRF name="Mixed random variable"}
A **mixed random variable** has subsets where the random variable is [discrete](#def:DiscreteRF) and subsets where the random variable is [continuous](#def:ContinuousRF).
:::


:::{.example #MixeVehicleWait name="Vehicle wait times"}
Consider the time spent by vehicles waiting at a set of traffic lights before proceeding through the intersection.

If the light is green on arrival, the wait time is exactly zero (i.e., discrete): the vehicle can drive straight through the intersection.
A wait time of zero seconds can be measured exactly.

However, if the light is red on arrival, the vehicle needs to  wait a continuous amount of time before it turns green.

The time spent waiting is a *mixed* random variable.
:::




## Univariate probability functions {#UnivariateProbabilityFunctions}

The previous section introduced *random variables*: real values assigned to outcomes in the sample space.
Often, many elements of the sample space were assigned to the same value of the random variable.
Therefore, we can assign *probabilities* to various values of the random variable, and develop a *probability model* for the random variable.

A *model* describes theoretical patterns over infinite trials.
On any single roll of a die, a `r knitr::include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=2000)` may or may not occur, but theoretically (and for infinite rolls) we expect a `r knitr::include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=2000)` to appear 1/6 of the time.
A *probability model* describes the probability that various values of the random variable might appear on any one realisation in theory.

This probability model is called the *probability function*.

::: {.example #TossingCoinOutcomes name="Tossing coin outcomes"}
Consider tossing a coin twice and observing the outcome of the two tosses. 
Since a random variable is a *real-valued function*, simply observing the outcome as $\{H, T\}$, for example, does not define a random variable. 

We could define the random variable of interest, say $H$, as the *number* of heads on the two tosses of the coin.
The *sample space* for the experiment is 
\[
   S = \{ (TT), (TH), (HT), (HH)\}.
\]
The connection between the sample space and $H$ is shown in the table below.
In this case, the range space of $H$ is $R_H = \{0, 1, 2\}$.


*Element of $S$* | *Function $H(s)$*                     | *Value of $H$*   | *$\Pr(H = s_i)$*
-----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|------
$TT$             | $H(s_1)$: Number of heads in $s_1$    | 0                | $1/4$
$TH$             | $H(s_2)$: Number of heads in $s_2$    | 1                | $1/4$
$HT$             | $H(s_3)$: Number of heads in $s_3$    | 1                | $1/4$
$HH$             | $H(s_4)$: Number of heads in $s_4$    | 2                | $1/4$

The *probability function* could be defined as
\begin{align*}
      \Pr(H = 0):&\quad 1/4\\
      \Pr(H = 1):&\quad 1/2\\
      \Pr(H = 2):&\quad 1/4\\
      \Pr(H = h):&\quad 0\quad \text{for all other values of $h$}.
\end{align*}
:::


Distinguishing between discrete, continuous and mixed random variables is useful, as the probability functions depend on the distinction.


### Discrete random variables: Probability mass functions {#ProbabilityFunctionsDiscrete}

For a discrete random variable, the *probability function* indicates how probabilities are assigned to the values of the discrete random variable.
For a discrete random variable, the probability function often called the *probability mass function* (or pmf).

::: {.definition #ProbabilityFunction name="Probability function"}
Let the range space of the discrete random variable $X$ be $R_X$.
With each $x\in R_X$, associate a number 

\[
   p_X(x) = \Pr(X = x).
\]
The function $p_X$ is called the *probability function* of $X$.
:::



The following properties of the probability function are implied by the definition and the rules of probability.

1. $p_X(t) \ge 0$ for all values of $t$; that is, probabilities are never negative.
2. $\displaystyle \sum_{t \in R_X}  p_X(t) = 1$ where $R_X$ is the range of $X$; that is, the probability function accounts for all possible sample points in the sample space.
3. $p_X(t) = 0$ if $t \notin R_X$.
4. For an event $A$ defined on a sample space $S$, the probability of event $A$ is computed using
   \[
      \Pr(A) = \sum_{t\in A} p_X(t).
   \]


::: {.definition #ProbabilityDistribution name="Probability distribution"}
If
\[
   R_X =\{ x_1, x_2, \dots \},
\]
the pair
\[
   \{ \big(x_i, p_X(x_i)\big); \quad i = 1, 2,\dots\}
\]
is called the *probability distribution* of the discrete random variable $X$.
:::

The probability distribution of a discrete random variable $X$ can be represented by listing each outcome with its probability, giving a formula, using a table or using a graph which displays the probabilities $p(x)$ corresponding to each $x\in R_X$.

Sometimes the probability function is denoted $p(x)$ rather than $p_X(x)$.
Using the subscript avoids confusion in situations where many random variables are considered at once.
The subscript is used throughout this book.

The probability distribution of a random variable is a description of the range space, or value set, of the variable and the associated assignment of probabilities.



::: {.example #Independence name="Independence"}
Five balls numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are in an urn.
Two balls are selected at random.
Consider finding the probability distribution of the *larger* of the two numbers.
The sample space is:
\[ 
    S =\{ (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)\},
\]
where all 10 elements are equally likely.

Let $X$ be the random variable 'the *larger* of the two numbers chosen'.
Then $R_X = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$.
Listing the probabilities:
\begin{align*}
     \Pr(X = 2) &= \Pr\big((1, 2)\big) &= 1/10;\\
     \Pr(X = 3) &= \Pr\big((1, 3) \text{ or }  (2, 3)\big) &= 2/10;\\
     \Pr(X = 4) &= \Pr\big((1, 4) \text{ or } (2, 4) \text{ or } (3, 4)\big) &= 3/10;\\
     \Pr(X = 5) &= \Pr\big((1, 5) \text{ or } (2, 5) \text{ or } (3, 5)\text{ or } (4, 5)\big) &= 4/10.
\end{align*}
This is the probability distribution of $X$, which could also be given as a formula:
\[ 
   \Pr(X = x) = 
   \begin{cases}
      (x - 1)/10 & \text{for $x = 2, 3, 4, 5$}\\
      0 & \text{elsewhere}.
  \end{cases}
\]
The probability function could also be given in a table (Table \@ref(tab:LargestDie)) or graph (Fig. \@ref(fig:ProbDist1)).

::: {.example #TossingHeads name="Tossing heads"}
Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice, and the uppermost face is noted.
Then the *sample space* is 
\[
   S = \{ (HH), (HT), (TH), (TT) \}.
\]
Let $H$ be the *number* of heads observed.
$H$ is a (discrete) random variable, and the range of $H$ is $R_H = \{0, 1, 2\}$, representing the values that $H$ can take.

The probability function maps each of these values to the associated probability.
Using techniques from Chap. \@ref(Probability), the probabilities are:
\begin{align*}
   \Pr(H = 0) &= \Pr(\text{no heads}) = 0.25;\\
   \Pr(H = 1) &= \Pr(\text{one head}) = 0.5;\\
   \Pr(H = 2) &= \Pr(\text{two heads}) = 0.25.
\end{align*}
As a function, the probability function is
\[
   p_H(h) = \Pr(H = h) 
          = \begin{cases}
               0.25 & \text{if $h = 0$};\\

More succinctly, 
\[

### Continuous random variables: Probability density functions {#ProbabilityFunctionsContinuous}

Using probability functions to describe the distribution of a continuous random variable is tricky, because probability behaves like mass at points.
In the discrete case, mass can be distributed over a number (possibly countably infinite) of distinct points where each point has non-zero mass.
However, in the continuous case, mass cannot be thought of as an attribute of a *point* but rather of a *region* surrounding a point.

The ideas from Example \@ref(exm:ContinuousProbs) are relevant here: The probabiity of throwing a cricket ball within two distances.


::: {.definition #ProbabilityDensityFunction name="Probability density function"}
The *probability density function* (pdf) of the continuous random variable $X$ is a function $f_X(\cdot)$ such that
\[
   \Pr(a < X \le b) = \int_a^b f_X(x)\,dx
\]
for any interval $(a, b]$ (where $a < b$) on the real line.
:::


We are usually only concerned with $a, b\in R_X$, but it makes sense to think of the pdf as defined for all $x$, insisting that $f_X(x) = 0$ for $x\notin R_X$.
This definition states that *areas under the graph of the pdf represent probabilities* and leads to the following properties of the probability density function.

1. $f_X(x) \ge 0$ for all $-\infty < x < \infty$:
   The density function is never negative.
2. $\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x)\,dx = 1$:
   The total probability is one.
3. For an event $E$ defined on a sample space $S$, the probability of event $E$ is computed using
   \[
      \Pr(E) = \int_{E} f_X(x)\, dx.
   \]
4. Since exact values are not possible:
   \begin{align*}
         &\Pr(a < X \le b) = \Pr(a < X < b)\\
      {} &= \Pr(a \le X < b) = \Pr(a \le X \le b) = \int_a^b f_X(x)\,dx
    \end{align*}
5. From the *Mean Value Theorem* in calculus, for small $\Delta x$:
   \[ 
      \Pr(x < X < x + \Delta x) = \int ^{x + \Delta x}_x f(t)\, dt = \Delta xf(\xi ), \quad x < \xi < x + \Delta x.
   \]
6. For $\Delta x$ small,
   \begin{equation}
     \Pr(x < X < x +\Delta x)\simeq f(x)\Delta x.
   \end{equation}

Properties 1 and 2 are sufficient to prove that a function is a pdf:
To show that some function $g(x)$ is a pdf, showing that $g(x) \ge 0$ for all $-\infty < x < \infty$ and that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)\,dx = 1$ is sufficient.

Property 4 results from noting that if $X$ is a continuous random variable, $\Pr(X = a ) = 0$ for any and every value $a$ for the same reason that a point has mass zero.

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The value of a pdf at some point $x$ does not represent a probability, but rather a *probability density*.
Hence, the pdf can have any non-negative value of arbitrary size at a specific value of $X$.
:::

Properties 5 and 6 directly relate the idea of a density to that of a probability.
These properties often find use in making approximations and in theoretical work.

NEED 5 **AND** 6, OR COMBINE???


::: {.example #ProbabilityDensityFunction name="Probability density function"}
Consider the continuous random variable $W$ with the pdf
\[
   f_W(w) = 
   \begin{cases}
      2w & \text{for $0 < w < 1$}\\
      0  & \text{elsewhere}.
   \end{cases}
\]
The probability $\Pr(0 < W < 0.5)$ can be computed in two ways.
One is to use calculus:
\[
   \Pr(0 < W < 0.5) = w^2\Big|_0^{0.5} = 0.25.
\]
Alternately, the probability can be computed *geometrically* from the graph of the pdf (Fig. \@ref(fig:ContinuousPDF)).
The region corresponding to $\Pr(0 < W < 0.5)$ is triangular; integration simply finds the area of this triangle.
The area can also be found using the area of a triangle directly: the length of the base of the triangle, times the height of the rectangle, divided by two:
\[
   0.5 \times 1 /2 = 0.25,
\]
and the answer is the same as before.

Note that $F = f_W(w)$ is greater than one for some values of $w$.
Since $f_W(w)$ does not represent probabilities at each point (as $W$ is continuous), this is not a problem.
However, $\int_{\mathbb{R}} f_W(w) \, dw = 1$ as required of a probability density.

### Mixed random variables {#ProbabilityFunctionsMixed}

Some random variables are neither continuous nor discrete, but have components of both.
These random variables are called *mixed random variables*.


::: {.example #MixedRandomVariable name="Mixed random variable"}
In a factory producing diodes, a proportion of the diodes $p$ fail immediately.
The distribution of the lifetime (in hundred of days), say $Y$, of the diodes is given by a discrete component at $y = 0$ for which $\Pr(Y = 0) = p$, and a continuous part for $y > 0$ described by
\[
   f_Y(y) = (1 - p) \exp(-y) \quad \text{if $y > 0$.}
\]
Here, $f_Y(y)$ is not itself a pdf as it doesn't integrate to one; however the total probability is
\[
   p + \int_0^\infty (1 - p)\exp(-y) \, dy = p + (1 - p) = 1
\]
as required.

Consider a diode for which $p = 0.4$.
The probability distribution is displayed in Fig. \@ref(fig:Diode) where a solid dot is included to show the discrete part.


```{r Diode, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The probability function for the diodes example", fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
p <- 0.4
x <- seq(0, 4, 
         length = 100)
fy <- (1 - p) * exp( - x)
fy[1] <- 1 - p

Fy <- 0.4 + 0.6 * (1 - exp(-x ) )
F[1] <- p

plot(fy ~ x,
     lwd = 2,
     type = "l",
     xlim = c(-1, 4),
     xlab = expression(italic(Y)),
     ylab = expression(italic(f)[italic(y)](italic(y))),
     main = "Probability function",
     las = 1)
points( x = 0,
        y = 0.4,
        pch = 19)
points( x = 0,
        y = 0.6,
        pch = 1)

```

Representing the probability distribution in this mixed case is difficult, because of the need to combine a probability distribution and a pdf.
These difficulties are overcome by using the distribution function (Sect. \@ref(DistributionFunction)).
:::



## The distribution function {#DistributionFunction}

Another way of describing random variables is using a *distribution function* (df), also called a *cumulative distribution function* (cdf).
The df gives the probability that a random variable $X$ is less than *or equal to* a given value $t$.

::: {.definition #DistributionFunction name="Distribution function"}
For any random variable $X$ the *distribution function*, $F_X(x)$, is given by
\[
     F_X(x) = \Pr(X \leq x) \quad \text{for $-\infty < x < \infty$}.
\]
:::


The distribution function applies to discrete, continuous or mixed random variables.
Importantly:

1. The definition includes a less than *or equal to* sign.
2. The distribution function is defined on the *entire* real line.


If $X$ is a discrete random variable with range space $R_X$, then the df is
\begin{align*}
     F_X(x)
     &= \Pr(X \leq x)\\
     &= \sum_{x_i \leq x} \Pr(X = x_i)\text{ for }x_i\in R_X,\text{ and }-\infty < x < \infty.
\end{align*}
If $X$ is a continuous random variable, the df,
\begin{align*}
     F_(x)
     &= \Pr(X \leq x)\\
     &= \int^x_{-\infty} f(t)\,dt \text{ for } -\infty < x < \infty.
\end{align*}


::: {.example #TossingHeads2 name="Tossing heads"}
Consider the simple example in Example \@ref(exm:TossingHeads) where a coin is tossed once.
The probability function for $H$ is given in that Example in numerous forms.
To determine the df, first note that when $t < 0$, the accumulated probability is zero; hence, $F_H(t) = 0$ when $t < 0$.
At $t = 0$, the probability of $0.25$ is accumulated all at once, and no more probability is accumulated until $t = 1$.
Thus, $F_H(t) = 0.25$ for $0 \le t< 1$.
Continuing, the df is 
\[
   F_H(t) = \begin{cases}
               0 & \text{for $h < 0$};\\
               0.25 & \text{for $0\le h < 1$};\\
               0.75 & \text{for $1\le h < 2$};\\
               1 & \text{for $h\ge 2$}.
            \end{cases}
\]
The df can be displayed graphically, being careful to clarify what happens at $H = 1$, $H = 2$ and $H = 3$ using open or filled circles (Fig. \@ref(fig:HeadsDF)).

Consider a continuous random variable $V$ with pdf
\[

:::


Properties of the df are stated below.

1. $0\leq F_X(x)\leq 1$ because $F_X(x)$ is a probability.
2. $F_X(x)$ is a non-decreasing function of $x$.
   That is, if $x_1 < x_2$ then $F_X(x_1) \leq F_X(x_2)$.
3. $\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to \infty} F_X(x)} = 1$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to -\infty} F_X(x)} = 0$.
4. $\Pr(a < X \leq b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)$.
5. If $X$ is discrete, then $F_X(x)$ is a step-function.
   If $X$ is continuous, then $F_X$ will be a continuous function for all $x$.


We have seen how to find $F_X(x)$ given $\Pr(X = x)$, or to find $F_X(x)$ given $f_X(x)$.
But can we proceed in the other direction too?
That is, given $F_X(x)$, how do we find $\Pr(X = x)$ for $X$ discrete, or $f_X(x)$ for $X$ continuous?

As seen from the graph of the df in Example \@ref(exm:TossingHeads2), the values of $x$ where a 'jump' in $F_X(x)$ occurs are the points in the range space, and the probability associated with a particular point in $R_X$ is the 'height' of the jump there.
That is,
\begin{equation}
      p_X(x_j) = \Pr(X = x_j) = F_X(x_j) - F_X(x_{j - 1}).
\end{equation}

For $X$ continuous, from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
\begin{equation}
     f_X(x) = \frac{dF_X(x)}{dx} \quad \text{where the derivative exists.}
        (\#eq:DFtoPDF)
\end{equation}


:::{.example #DistributionFn1, name="Distribution function"}
Consider the df
\[
   F_X(x) =

      1        & \text{for $x > 1$.}
   \end{cases}
\]
To find the pdf, use \@ref(eq:DFtoPDF):
\[
   f_X(x) = 
   \begin{cases}
      \frac{d}{dx} 0        & \text{for $x < 0 $};\\
      \frac{d}{dx} x(2 - x) & \text{for $x \le x \le 1$};\\
      \frac{d}{dx} 1        & \text{for $x > 1$}
   \end{cases}
   =
      \begin{cases}
      0        & \text{for $x < 0 $};\\
      2(1 - x) & \text{for $x \le x \le 1$};\\
      0        & \text{for $x > 1$}
   \end{cases}
\]
which is usually written as $f_X(x) = 2(1 - x)$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $0$ elsewhere,
