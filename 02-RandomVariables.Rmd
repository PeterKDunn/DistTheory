## Introduction

In Module~\ref{SC:prob}, the tools of probability were used to assist in answering questions about phenomena involving uncertainty.  
The sample space was defined as the set of all possible outcomes and an event was defined as a subset of the sample space.  
Probabilities were associated with events.  
The outcomes themselves could be numeric, as in tossing a die, or non-numeric, as in tossing a coin.

Interestingly it turns out that it is advantageous to restrict ourselves to numerical outcomes from experiments.  
This may sound unnecessarily restrictive, but is not.
After all, we are quite at liberty to number all the outcomes in the sample space, thereby converting non-numeric elements to numeric ones.  
So, for example, heads could be denoted 1 and tails 2 in the sample space associated with tossing a coin.

This might sounds a bit unnecessary, and in the case of coin tossing it probably is.
However by restricting ourselves to numeric outcomes we can make use of the powerful concepts that are associated with numbers.  
In particular the concepts of discreteness, continuousness, types of infinity, limits, etc. are available.  
So what might appear to be a restrictive step is in reality the key to unlocking some powerful ideas and results that make probability theory and in turn, statistical theory, a force to be reckoned.

Of course, in most scientific, engineering and business applications, our interests are in assigning probabilities to numeric outcomes.  
For example,

* Probabilities can be assigned to different amounts of money made by an investment
* Probabilities can be assigned to the proportion of people that contract a given disease
* Probabilities can be assigned to observing different water levels at a certain river crossing
* Probabilities can be assigned to matching DNA sequences when their genome sequences are almost identical
* Probabilities can be assigned to recording certain rainfall amounts.


The point however is that some experiments give rise to just a limited number of outcomes (eg tossing a die), some give rise to an unlimited number of discrete outcomes (eg the number of attempts needed to win a lottery) and some give rise to a range of possible outcomes over some interval (eg water levels, rainfall, tomorrow's maximum temperature).
The differences amongst these types of sample spaces is what drives us to thinking in terms of discrete numbers (such as integers) and continuous numbers (such as the reals).

To make the connection we define something called a *random variable* on the sample space.
This is simply a way of converting the elements of the sample space into numbers.
Depending on the type of sample space, this random variable can be discrete, continuous, or a mixture of both.
Regardless, it is useful and important to be able to describe the possible values of the random variable and the probability associated with these values.  
This is called the *distribution of the random variable* and is the concept underlying the name of this course.

As an example, when a fair die is rolled, the classical approach to probability can be used to determine the theoretical probabilities $\Pr(\text{roll\ a\ \epsdice{1}}) = \Pr(\text{roll\ a\ \epsdice{2}}) = \cdots = \Pr(\text{roll a \epsdice{6}}) = 1/6$.
If we define a random variable $X$ in this experiment as the number of pips showing on the die then we see, for example, that $X = 1$ for the outcome $\epsdice{1}$. 
Consequently we have $\Pr(X = 1) = \Pr(X = 2) = \dots = \Pr(X = 6) = 1/6$ and this describes the distribution of the random variable $X$ for this experiment.

This random variable $X$ is discrete and the distribution of $X$ is an example of a *discrete uniform distribution* for obvious reasons.  
We learn more about this distribution in Section~\ref{SC:specdiscrete:uniform}.

When a die is rolled repeatedly, and the relative frequency is determined for each value of $X$, we don't of course get 1/6 for each.  
We recognise the discrete uniform distribution is a theoretical distribution based on the principle of indifference as described in section~\ref{SS:classical}.
The observed distribution of relative frequencies based on actual dice tossing will only approximate the theoretical distribution.
How well the two match we would be justified in thinking depends on how many times the die is tossed and how balanced it is.
This is an investigation we pursue later.

The theoretical distribution is said to *model* the experiment.
Hence the discrete uniform distribution is a model for dice tossing.
The classical approach to assignment of probabilities gives us a model in this case.  
For other experiments other models will be appropriate.

This module discusses the concept of the random variable and the distribution of probabilities amongst the values of a random variable.
Further modules describe specific distributions useful in modelling experiments.


## Random variables

Colloquially, a random variable is a numerical-valued variable. 
A random variable may be *continuous*, *discrete* or a combination of the two.  
Some examples follow the more formal definition below.

:::{.definition DomainRange, name="Domain and range"}
A random variable $X$ is a *real-valued function* mapping each element of the sample space into a real number. 
The *domain* of a random variable is the sample space, and the *range space* or *value set* is the set of real numbers taken by function.
:::

The random variable $X$ can be thought of as a rule assigning a number to each and every outcome in the sample space.

Using functional notation we see that a function $X$ assigning to every sample point $s\in S$ a real number $X(s)$ is a random variable.
Further, since $X$ is a function, to every $s\in S$ there corresponds exactly one value $X(s)$.  
The domain of $X$ is the set $S$ and the range space is the set $\{X(s)\mid s\in S\}$.

Commonly, ``random variable'' is abbreviated to rv.

A *discrete* random variable (rv) is defined on a discrete sample space.
Examples of discrete random variables include:

* The number of mice in a cohort of twenty that develop an illness
* The number of rain events occurring during a week
* The amount of money in a person's pocket
* The shoe size of a person
* The number of attempts needed to win Lotto
* The number of offspring successfully reared by an endangered species of bird
* The gender (after coding) of the next customer.

The last example might need explaining.  
The sample space for the associated experiment contains two points `female' and `male'; i.e., $S = \{\text{female},\text{male}\}$. 
A random variable though must be numeric so if `Gender' is to be a random variable we must associate the outcomes in the sample space with numerical values; e.g., an arbitrary coding such as 0 for `female' and 1 for `male' achieves this.  
We can then write $X(\text{female}) = 0$ and $X(\text{male}) = 1$ where $X$ denotes the random variable `Gender'.
Notice the range space or value set of $X$ is $\{0,1\}$ which we might denote as $R_X$.

NOTE CODE IS ARBITRARY!

Often we dispense with formal functional notation when defining random variables and write, for example,
\[
   X = 
   \begin{cases} 
      0 & \text{if female}\\
      1 & \text{if male}
    \end{cases}
\]

Incidentally don't confuse the *definition* of a random variable with the *values* of the random variable.
In the last example, the rv `Gender' can have two values, female or male coded as 0 or 1. 
`Male' or 0 is not a rv; it is one *value* of the rv `Gender'.

Loosely speaking, a *continuous* random variable is one that can never be measured exactly. 
If a random variable can assume any value or a set of values in an interval, then it is called *continuous*. 
For example, consider your height. 
Your height could be recorded as 174\,cm, but with better measuring instruments it may be 174.023\,451\,006\,cm, and even more decimals are possible
with even better instruments! 
Even though height may be written down to the nearest centimetre or even millimetre, height itself is still a continuous measure. 
In addition, your height does not change by a distinct amount. 
My baby daughter grows continually; she doesn't grow in jumps of 1cm, for example! 
Examples of continuous random variables include:

* The volume of waste water treated at a sewage plant per day
* The amount of money made (or lost) by an investment over 12 months
* The weight of hearts in normal rats
* The lengths of the wings of butterflies
* The lifetime of diseased mice after taking an experimental drug
* The yield of barley from a large paddock
* The amount of rainfall recorded each year
* The time taken to perform a psychological test.



Mixed random variables are less common. 
Typically, they consist of a quantity that can be measured exactly (discrete) sometimes and inexactly (continuous) at other times. 
Consider, for example, the time spent waiting at a set of traffic lights before proceeding.
If the light is already green when you arrive, you can drive straight through and have to wait exactly zero seconds (the discrete part). 
If the light is red when you arrive, you have to wait a continuous amount of time before it turns green and you go.
Hence, the time spent waiting is a mixed random variable.

\begin{sbexample}
The \emph{Sunday Mail} newspaper (Brisbane, Australia) on 21
December 1997 gave data giving the birth weight, gender, and time
of birth of 44 babies born in the 24-hour period of 18 December
1997 at the Mater Mother's Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. The
gender of the babies is a discrete random variable; the birth
weight and time of birth are continuous. The data can be used to
determine the number of births each hour (discrete) and the time
between births (continuous).
\end{sbexample}

\begin{sbexample}
Consider tossing a coin twice and observing the outcome of the two
tosses. Since a random variable is a \emph{real-valued function},
simply observing the outcome as $\{\head, \tail\}$, for example,
is not a rv. We could define the rv of interest, say $H$, as the
\emph{number} of heads on the two tosses of the coin. The
\emph{sample space} for the experiment is $S=\{ (\tail\tail),
(\tail\head), (\head\tail), (\head\head)\}$. The connection
between the sample space and $H$ is shown in
Table~\ref{TB:prob:samplespace}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Element of $S$ & Function $H$  & Value of $H$
\botnewrule\\
\hline \topnewrule
$(\tail\tail) = s_1$ & $H(s_1)$, the number of heads in $s_1$ & $0$\\
$(\tail\head) = s_2$ & $H(s_2)$, the number of heads in $s_2$ & $1$\\
$(\head\tail) = s_3$ & $H(s_3)$, the number of heads in $s_3$ & $1$\\
$(\head\head) = s_4$ & $H(s_4)$, the number of heads in $s_4$ & $2$\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{The random variable $H$ maps each element in the sample
space $S$ to a real number.} \label{TB:prob:samplespace}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In this case, the range of $H$ is $R_H=\{0, 1, 2\}$.
\end{sbexample}\label{EG:2coins}


Methods for describing random variables and how probabilities are
assigned or distributed amongst the values of a random variable
occupies much of this course.

One of the reasons for distinguishing between discrete and
continuous random variables is that the ways we can describe the
distribution of probabilities depend to some extent on this
distinction.



\section{Univariate distributions}\label{SC:unidist}

\reading{\WMS, Section~3.2.}

This section focuses on methods of describing the distribution of
probabilities amongst the values of a random variable.
We need to consider separately discrete and continuous rvs.


\subsection{The probability function}\label{SS:probfnc}

The \emph{probability function}
is a function that indicates how probabilities
are assigned to the values of a discrete rv; that is,
a rv with range space that is finite or countably infinite.


\begin{definition}
Let the range space of the discrete rv $X$ be $R_X$.
With each $x\in R_X$ we associate a number
$$p_X(x)=\Pr{X=x}$$

The function $p_X$ is called the \emph{probability function} of $X$.
\end{definition}

Some texts call the probability function, the probability mass function.

\begin{definition} If $R_X =\{ x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n, \dots
\}$, the set  $ \{ (x_i,p_X(x_i);\quad i=1,2,\dots\}$
is called the \emph{probability distribution} of the discrete rv $X$.
\end{definition}

\WMS\ and \DGS\ denote the probability function as $p(x)$ rather than $p_X(x)$.
Using the subscript is recommended to avoid confusion in situations where
a number of random variables are on the go.  So if we are dealing with the discrete
rv's $X$ and $Y$ we can denote their respective probability distributions by
$p_X$ and $p_Y$ respectively.  We use this subscript idea where appropriate throughout
this course.

Essentially the probability distribution of a random variable is a description
of the range space or value set of the variable and the associated assignment
of probabilities.  The above definition only applies to a discrete rv.

The probability distribution of a discrete rv $X$ can be represented by a
formula, a table or a graph which displays the probabilities $p(x)$
corresponding to each $x\in R_X$.


\begin{sbexample}
\label{R2.1}
Five balls numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are in a box.
Two balls are selected at random.  Find the probability distribution
of the larger of the two numbers.
     \[ S =\{ (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4)_,(3,5),(4,5)\}
\]
     and all 10 points are equally likely.

     Let rv $X$ be the larger of the 2 numbers chosen.  Then $R_X =\{2,3,4,5]$ and

    \begin{align*}
     \Pr{X=2} &= \Pr{(1,2)}=1/10\\
     \Pr{X=3} &= \Pr{(1,3) \mbox{ or }  (2,3)}=2/10\\
     \Pr{X=4} &= \Pr{(1,4) \mbox{ or } (2,4) \mbox{ or } (3,4)} = 3/10\\
     \Pr{X=5} &= \Pr{(1,5) \mbox{ or } (2,5) \mbox{ or } (3,5)\mbox{ or } (4,5)} = 4/10.
     \end{align*}
     This is the probability distribution of $X$ but it can be expressed
more neatly as a `formula',
     \[ \Pr{X=x} = (x-1)/10, \quad x=2,3,4,5, \]
     or shown in a table
     \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
     x & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
     \hline
     $\Pr{X=x}$ & .1 & .2 & .3 & .4
     \end{tabular}
     or as a graph as in Figure \ref{fig2.1}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\hspace{20mm}

\caption{Probability distribution of $X$}\label{fig2.1}
\end{figure}

\emph{Computer exercise} Write an \R\ function to allow you to simulate
the distribution in this example.
\end{sbexample}

\begin{sbexample}
\label{EG:rvs:heads}
Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice.
Then the \emph{sample space} is
$S=\{\head\head, \head\tail, \tail\head, \tail\tail\}$.
Let $H$ be the \emph{number} of heads observed.
$H$ is a (discrete) random variable,
and the range of $H$ is $R_H = \{0, 1, 2\}$,
representing the values that $H$ can take.
The probability function maps each of these values
to the associated probability.
Using techniques from Module~\ref{SC:prob},
the probabilities can be computed and given as a list:
\begin{align*}
   \Pr{H=0} =\,& \Pr{\mbox{no heads}} = 0.25\\
   \Pr{H=1} =\,& \Pr{\mbox{one head}} = 0.5\\
   \Pr{H=2} =\,& \Pr{\mbox{two heads}} = 0.25.
\end{align*}
This information can be presented as a table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
$h$: & $0$ & $1$ & $2$ \\
$\Pr{H=h}:$ & $0.25$ & $0.5$ & $0.25$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As a function,
the probability function could be written as
\[
   p_H(h) = \Pr{H=h} = \begin{cases}
               0.25 & \mbox{if $h=0$}\\
               0.5 & \mbox{if $h=1$}\\
               0.25 & \mbox{if $h=2$}\\
               0 & \mbox{otherwise}
              \end{cases}
\]
(Recall that the upper case~$H$ refers to the name of the rv.)
For the more adventurous,
it could also be given as
\[
   p_H(h) = \Pr{H=h} = \begin{cases}
                  (0.5)0.5^{|h-1|} & \mbox{for $h=0$, $1$ or $2$}\\
                  0 & \mbox{otherwise}
              \end{cases}
\]
Graphically,
the probability function could be shown as in
Figure~\ref{FG:rvs:heads}.
For discrete distributions,
the pf can be displayed using the `stick' approach in this
figure,
or a histogram.

Note that $\sum_{t \in \{0, 1, 2\}} p_H(t) = 1$
and $p_H(h)\ge0$ for all $h$
as required of a pf.

\end{sbexample}


The following properties of the probability function are implied by the definition.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item
   $p_X(t)\ge0$ for all values of $t$;
   that is, probabilities are never negative;
   \item
   $\displaystyle \sum_{t\in R_X}  p_X(t) = 1$ where $R_X$ is the range of $X$;
   that is,
   the probability function accounts for all possible sample points
   in the sample space;

   \item
   $p_X(t)=0$ if $t\not\in R_X$;

   \item
   For an event $A$ defined on a sample space $S$,
   the probability of event $A$ is computed using
   \[
      \Pr{A} = \sum_{t\in A} p_X(t).
   \]

\end{enumerate}

Don't be put off by the use of $t$ in these properties; $x$, $y$ or any other letter
could also have been used.  The letter simply represents a particular value of the rv.

The distinction between upper and lower case letters though when
discussing rv's is worth noting.  Consider the notation $p_X(x)$
used to define the probability function.
The upper case~$X$ is the \emph{name} of the random variable;
the lower case~$x$ is a \emph{particular value} that the random variable~$X$ may take.
For example, if I roll a standard die,
the random variable of interest may be ``the number on the top face'',
which may be called~$X$.
Then, the \emph{values} that this random variable can take are
$x=1$, $x=2$ through to $x=6$.
So the notation $\Pr{X=1}$ means
``the probability that the number of the top face
(that is, $X$)
will be equal
(that is, the equal to sign ${}={}$)
to the particular value~$1$''.
In general,
upper case (usually Roman, not Greek) letters refer to
the \emph{name} of a random variable;
lower case Roman letters refer to the values the variable can take.

There are times when it's difficult to know whether its the rv itself or a value
of the rv that is being referred to.  Don't lose any sleep over it.  You
won't be penalised if you get it wrong.



\subsection{The probability density function}\label{SS:pdf}

\reading{\DGS, Section~3.2; \WMS, Sections~4.1 and~4.2.}

We run into a major difficulty when attempting to use a probability
function to describe the distribution of a continuous rv; that is, a rv
that can take on every value in a bounded or unbounded interval.

The problem arises because probability behaves like mass.
In the discrete case we imagine mass can be distributed over a number
(possibly countably infinite) of distinct points where each
point has non-zero mass.  This is sufficient to tell us all we
need to know about the mass or probability associated with any set
of points.

In the continuous case, mass cannot be thought of as an attribute of a point
but rather of a region surrounding a point in that as an object is shrunk
to a single point
its mass also shrinks to zero.
The only way we can retain information about how `massive' an object is
at a point is to consider its mass per unit volume in the neighbourhood
of that point and
consider what happens as the volume of the neighbourhood shrinks to zero.
This measure does not go to zero.  And it is familiar to all of us as (mass) density.

Not only does density have meaning at a point, it allows us to determine the mass
of an object by integration if we know the density at every point throughout the mass.

Similarly, to describe the probability distribution for a continuous rv
requires us to know the probability density at every point in the range space.
The function describing this density is naturally called the
\emph{probability density function}
or pdf.  Once the pdf is known we can determine by integration the probability
associated with any event defined on the range space.

Many texts (eg \DGS) either don't explicitly define the pdf or
define it indirectly (eg \WMS).
The definition given below relates directly to the idea of
a density as described above
but doesn't tell us much about how to actually find the function.

\begin{definition}
The \emph{probability density function} (pdf)
of the continuous rv $X$ is a function $f_X$ such that
$$\Pr{a<X\le b} = \int_a^b f_X(x)\,dx$$
for any interval $(a,b]$ ($a<b$) on the real line.
\end{definition}

We are usually only concerned with $a,b\in R_X$ but it makes sense
to think of the pdf
as defined for all $x$, insisting that $f_X(x)=0$ for $x\notin R_x$.
This definition focuses on the idea that areas under the graph of the pdf
represent probabilities and leads to the following properties.



The following properties of the probability density function are implied
by the definition.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item
   $f_X(x) \ge 0$ for all $-\infty<x<\infty$
    \item
   $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x)\,dx=1$
      \item
   For an event $E$ defined on a sample space $S$,
   the probability of event $E$ is computed using
   \[
      \Pr{E} = \int_{E} f_X(x)\, dx
   \]
   \item
   $\Pr{a<X\le b} = \Pr{a<X< b} = \Pr{a\le X< b} = \Pr{a\le X\le b} =\int_a^b f_X(x)\,dx$
   \item
   From the mean value theorem in calculus it follows that
     \[ \Pr{x < X < x + \Delta x} = \int ^{x+\Delta x}_x f(t)\, dt = \Delta
xf(\xi ), \ x<\xi < x + \Delta x \]
   \item  For $\Delta x$ small,
     \begin{equation}
     \Pr{x<X <x+\Delta x}\simeq f(x)\Delta x
     \end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

Properties 1 and 2 are sufficient to prove that a function is a pdf; ie if we're
asked to show that some function $g(x)$ is a pdf all we need do is show that
$g(x) \ge 0$ for all $-\infty<x<\infty$ and that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)\,dx=1$.

Property 4 results from noting that if $X$ is a continuous rv,
$\Pr{X=a}=0$ for any and every value~$a$ for the same reason that
a point has mass zero.

%Properties 5 and 6 are useful in theoretical work and in approximations.

It's important to remember that the value of a pdf at some point $x$ does not represent
a probability, but rather a probability density, and as such can have any non-negative
value of arbitrary size.  Properties 5 and 6 directly relate the idea of a density
to that of a probability.  These properties often find use in making approximations
and in theoretical work.

\begin{sbexample}
\label{EG:rvs:conteg}
Consider the continuous rv $W$
with the pdf
\[
   f_W(w) = 2w\quad\mbox{for $0<w<1$}
\]
There are two ways to compute the probability
$\Pr{0<W<0.5}$.
One is to use the pdf.
\begin{align*}
   \Pr{0<W<0.5}
   &= \int_0^{0.5} 2w\, dw\\
   &= w^2\Big|_0^{0.5}\\
   &= 0.25
\end{align*}

Alternately,
the probability can be computed geometrically.
The pdf is shown in
Figure~\ref{FG:rvs:conteg}.
The region corresponding to $\Pr{0<W<0.5}$
is triangular;
integration simply finds the area of this region.
The area can also be found using the area of a triangle:
the length of the base times the height,
divided by two.
So the area shaded is
\[
   \underbrace{0.5}_{\mbox{base}} \times \overbrace{1}^{\mbox{height}} /2 = 0.25,
\]
and the answer is the same as before.

\caption{The pdf of the rv $W$ from Example~\ref{EG:rvs:conteg}.
The shaded region is $\Pr{0<W<0.5}$.}
\label{FG:rvs:conteg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\end{sbexample}


\subsection{The distribution function}
\label{SS:rvs:distfunction}

\reading{\DGS, Section~3.3.}

Another way of describing rvs is using a
\emph{distribution function} (df),
also called a \emph{cumulative distribution function} (cdf).
We will use the df description in this course.

The df gives the probability that a random variable $X$
is less than or equal to a given value $t$.

\begin{definition}
For any rv $X$ the \emph{distribution function}, $F_X(x)$, is given by
     $$
     F_X(x)=\Pr{X\leq x}\quad\mbox{for $-\infty<x<\infty$}
     $$
\end{definition}

Note that the distribution function applies to
discrete or continuous or mixed (see below) rvs.

Two important points to note:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item
   The definition includes a less than \emph{or equal to} sign.
   \item
   The distribution function is defined for \emph{all} values of $x$.
\end{enumerate}

If $X$ is a discrete rv with range space $R_x$, the df,
     \begin{align*}
     F_X(x)&=\Pr{X\leq x}\\
         &=\sum_{x_i\leq x} \Pr{X=x_i}\mbox{ for }x_i\in R_x,\mbox{ and }-\infty<x<\infty
     \end{align*}

If $X$ is a continuous rv, the df,
     \begin{align*}
     F_(x)&=\Pr{X\leq x}
         = \int^x_{-\infty} f(t)\,dt \mbox{ for } -\infty<x<\infty
     \end{align*}


\begin{sbexample}
\label{EG:rvs:heads2}
Consider the simple example in
Example~\ref{EG:rvs:heads}.
The probability function for $H$ is given in that Example
in numerous forms.
To determine the df,
first note that when $t<0$,
the accumulated probability is zero;
hence,
$F_H(t) = 0 $ when $t<0$.
At $t=0$,
the probability of $0.25$ is accumulated,
and no more probability is accumulated until $t=1$.
Thus,
$F_H(t) = 0.25$ for $0\le t<1$.
Continuing, the df is
\[
   F_H(t) = \begin{cases}
               0 & \mbox{for $t<0$}\\
               0.25 & \mbox{for $0\le t<1$}\\
               0.75 & \mbox{for $1\le t<2$}\\
               1 & \mbox{for $t\ge 2$}
            \end{cases}
\]
Note that the variable $t$ is used where $-\infty<t<\infty$.
The df can be produced graphically,
being careful to clarify what happens at $X=1$, $X=2$ and $X=3$
using open or filled circles (see Figure~\ref{FG:rvs:headsdf}).

\label{FG:rvs:headsdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{sbexample}

\begin{sbexample}
Consider a continuous rv $V$ with pdf
\[
   f_V(v) = \begin{cases}
               v/2 & \mbox{for $0<v<2$}\\
               0 & \mbox{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
\]
The df is zero whenever $v\le 0$.
For $0<v<2$,
\[
   F_V(v) = \int_0^v t/2\,dt = v^2/4.
\]
Whenever $v\ge 2$,
the df is one.
So the df is
\[
   F_V(v) = \begin{cases}
               0 & \mbox{if $v\le 0$}\\
               v^2/4 & \mbox{if $0< v<2$}\\
               1 & \mbox{if $v\ge 2$}
             \end{cases}
\]

\Note: For the integral, \emph{do not write}
\[
   \int_0^v v/2\,dv
\]
It makes no sense to have the variable of integration
as a limit on the integral and also in the function to be integrated.
Either write the integral as given in the example,
or write
$\int_0^t v/2\,dv = t^2/4$
and then change the variable from $t$ to $v$.
\end{sbexample}

Note that if a random variable $X$ is discrete,
then the df will have points of discontinuity.
If the variable is continuous then the df will be continuous.

These and other properties of the df are stated below.

     \begin{enumerate}
     \item[(a)] $0\leq F_X(x)\leq 1$ because $F_X(x)$ is a probability.
     \item[(b)] $F_X(x)$ is a non-decreasing function of $x$.\\
     If $x_1 <x_2$ then $\{ x:x\leq x_1\} \subset \{ x:x\leq x_2\}$\\
     So $F_X(x_1)=\Pr{X\leq x_1}\leq \Pr{X\leq x_2}=F_X(x_2)$
     \item[(c)] Denoting $\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to \infty} F_X(x)}$ by
$F_X(\infty )$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to -\infty} F_X(x)}$ by $F_X(-\infty )$
we have $F_X(\infty )=1$ and $F_X(-\infty )=0$.
     \item[(d)] $\Pr{a<X \leq b}=F_X(b)-F_X(a)$
     \item[(e)] If $X$ is discrete then $F_X(x)$ is a step-function but if $X$
is continuous $F_X$ will be a continuous function for all $x$.
     \item[(f)] We can use (2.2) to find $F_X(x)$ given $\Pr{X=x}$ or (3.4)
to find $F_X(x)$ given $f_X(x)$
but we need to be able to proceed in the other direction as well.  That is,
given $F_X(x)$ how do we find $\Pr{X=x}$ for $X$ discrete or $f_X(x)$ for $X$
continuous?
     \begin{itemize}
     \item[(i)] It can be seen from the graph of the df in Example~\ref{EG:rvs:heads2} that
the values of $x$ where a `jump' in $F_X(x)$ occurs are the points in the
range space and the probability associated with a particular point in $R_X$
is the `height' of the jump there.  That is,
     \begin{equation}
      p_X(x_j) = \Pr{X=x_j}=F_X(x_j)-F_X(x_{j-1})
     \end{equation}
     \item[(ii)] For $X$ continuous, from the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus,
     \begin{equation}
     f_X(x)=\frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}\quad\mbox{where the derivative exists.}
     \end{equation}
     \end{itemize}
     \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Mixed random variables}\label{SS:mixedrv}

Some rvs are neither continuous nor discrete,
but have parts of both.
These rvs are called \emph{mixed random variables}.

\begin{sbexample}
\label{EG:rvs:diodemixed}
In a factory producing diodes,
a fraction of the diodes $p$ fail immediately.
The distribution of the lifetime
(in hundred of days), say $Y$,
of the diodes is given by a discrete part at $y=0$
for which $\Pr{Y=0}=p$ and a continuous part for $y>0$ described say
by the pdf
\[
   f_Y(y) = (1-p) \exp(-y)\quad\mbox{if $y>0$.}
\]

(Strictly speaking $f_Y(y)$ is not a proper pdf because it doesn't
integrate to one but we can see that the total probability is
\[
   0.4 + \int_0^\infty 0.6\exp(-y) \, dy = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1
\]
as required.)

Consider a diode for which $p=0.4$.
The probability distribution is displayed in
Figure~\ref{FG:rvs:mixed}~(a) where a solid dot is included to show the discrete part.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\subfigure[The probability distribution of
$Y$]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5,angle=270]{../pics/rvs/mixedpdf.eps}}
\subfigure[The distribution
function]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5,angle=270]{../pics/rvs/mixeddf.eps}}
\caption{A mixed random variable. In~(a), the pdf and probability
function; in~(b), the distribution function (see
Section~\ref{SS:rvs:distfunction}). In (a), the empty circle implies
the probability does not occur at this point.} \label{FG:rvs:mixed}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We see there are difficulties representing the probability distribution in this mixed case
because we need to combine a probability distribution and a pdf.  These difficulties
are circumvented by using the distribution function.  The df of $Y$ is
$$F_Y(y)=\begin{cases}
0 &\hbox{if $y<0$}\\
0.4&\hbox{if $y=0$}\\
0.4+0.6(1-\exp(-y))&\hbox{if $y>0$}
\end{cases}$$
\end{sbexample}

\section{Self-assessment exercises}

The following exercises are designed to provide practice at problem-solving
based on the material in this module. Solutions are provided at the end of the module.
Additional exercises are available in the next section and in the textbook.

\begin{exercises}

\item Find a formula for the pf of the number of heads observed in
five tosses of a fair coin. Compute the df also.

\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $X$ be the number of heads in five tosses. The range of
$X$ is $R_X=\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. There are a total of $2^5=32$
possible outcomes from the five tosses. Zero heads can occur in
$C^5_0 =1$ way; one head in $C^5_1 = 5$ ways; and so on. So the
probability of zero heads is $C^5_0/32$; and the probability of
one head is $C^5_1/32$; and so on. In general then,
\[
   p_X(x) = \Pr{X=x} =
      \begin{cases}
          \displaystyle\frac{ C^5_x}{32} & \mbox{ for $x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$}\\
          0 & \mbox{elsewhere}
      \end{cases}
\]
\item The df is
\[
   F_X(x) =
   \begin{cases}
      0 & \mbox{if $x<0$}\\
      1/32 & \mbox{if $0\le x<1$}\\
      6/32 & \mbox{if $1\le x<2$}\\
      16/32 & \mbox{if $2\le x<3$}\\
      26/32 & \mbox{if $3\le x<4$}\\
      31/32 & \mbox{if $4\le x<5$}\\
      1 & \mbox{if $x\ge 5$.}\\
   \end{cases}
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}


\item If the pdf of $X$ is
\[
   f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
               k\exp(-3x) & \mbox{$x>0$}\\
               0 & \mbox{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
\]
compute
\begin{enumerate}
   \item
   the value of $k$.
   \item
   the probability $\Pr{0.5<X<1}$.
   \item
   the df of $X$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, $f_X(x)\ge 0$ for all values of $x$ provided $k>0$.
Secondly,
\[
   \int_0^\infty  k\exp(-3x)\, dx = k \frac{\exp(-3x)}{-3}\Big|_{x=0}^{x=\infty} = k/3=1,
\]
so  $k=3$. \item $\Pr{0.5<X<1} = \int_{x=0.5}^{x=1} 3\exp(-3x)\,dx
\approx 0.173$. \item
\[
   F_X(x) = \int_{u=0}^{u=x} 3\exp(-3u)\,du = 3 \frac{\exp(-3u)}{-3}\Big|_{u=0}^{u=x}
          = 1-\exp(-3x).
\]
Therefore
\[
   F_X(x) = \begin{cases}
            0 & \mbox{if $x\le 0$}\\
            1 - \exp(-3x) & \mbox{if $x>0$}
            \end{cases}
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}


\item
Consider the rv $W$ with pf
\[
   p_W(w) = 0.6(0.4)^{w-1}
\]
when $w=1, 2, \dots$, and is zero elsewhere.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item
   Find $\Pr{W<5}$.

   \item
   Compute $\Pr{X>13}$.
   \item
   Compute $\Pr{X\le 10 \mid  X\le 15}$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
$F_X(x)=0$ for $x<10$, $F_X(x)=0.3$ for $10\le x<15$, $F_X(x)=0.5$
for $15\le x<20$, $F_X(x)=1$ for $x\ge 20$; $\Pr{X>13} = 1 -
F_X(13) = 0.7$; $\Pr{X\le 10\mid X\le 15} = \Pr{X\le 10}/\Pr{X\le15} =
F_X(10)/F_X(15) = 0.3/0.5 = 0.6$.
\end{answer}

\item
Consider the continuous rv $Z$ with pdf
\[
   f_Z(z) = \begin{cases}
               2(3-z)/15 & \mbox{for $-1<z<2$}\\
               0 & \mbox{elsewhere}
            \end{cases}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
   \item
    Find the df of $Z$.
   \item
   Find $\Pr{Z<0}$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item $F_Z(z)=0$ for $z\le -1$; $F_Z(z)=6z/15 - z^2/15 + 7/15$ for $-1<
z < 2$; $F_Z(z)=1$ for $z\ge 2$.
\item $\Pr{Z<0} = F_Z(0) = 7/15$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}


%\begin{answer}
%$\kappa=21.623732$; (no answer); $\Pr{0<Z<1} = 0.0547$.

\item

\item
(Computer exercise) Use \R\ to estimate $\Pr{0 \le X \le 0.5,
0\le Y \le 0.5}$ if the random vector, $(X,Y)$, has the bivariate
uniform distribution in Example~\ref{EG:3:bivunif}. (Generate a
random sample of size 500 from the bivariate uniform distribution
then count the number of pairs, $(x,y)$, which satisfy $0 < x <
0.5$ and $0 < y < 0.5$.)

\begin{answer}
\Method: First generate 500 random vectors $(X,Y)$ from the
bivariate uniform distribution in Example~\ref{EG:3:bivunif}. Do this by generating
two columns of 500 random numbers from a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$.
Each row then forms a random vector from the required distribution.
Count the number of $(x,y)$ that satisfy $0<x<0.5$ and $0<y<0.5$.
\begin{verbatim}
samsz<-500
u1<-runif(n=samsz,min=0,max=1)
u2<-runif(n=samsz,min=0,max=1)
# a logical vector T/F depending on whether conditions are met
datain<-(u1 < 0.5) & (u2 < 0.5)
# coercing the logical vector into a 1/0 vector and summing
N.cond.met<-sum(datain)
Pu1u2lt.half<-N.cond.met/samsz
print(Pu1u2lt.half)
\end{verbatim}

(For one simulation I obtained a sum of 120 giving and estimate of 0.24.)
Try repeating the simulation to give a total sample size of 1000.

Very little is known about the random variable $U$.  It is known,
however, that $U$ is a continuous random variable such that the
probability density function is zero for $U<-2$ and $U>4$, and is
non-zero for $-2<U<4$.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item
   Sketch a possible distribution function for $U$.  Label any important
   details of your sketch.

   \item
   It is later found  the median of $U$ is $2$.  On a fresh set
   of axes, sketch a possible distribution function for $U$.  Label
   any important details of your sketch.

\item
Suppose a fair coin is tossed three times, and a head (\head) or a
tail (\tail)
is recorded on each toss.  The two events $A$ and $B$ are defined as:\\
\quad $A$: The number of heads in the three tosses\\
\quad $B$: The number of heads in the first two tosses


\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct a joint probability table for the events $A$ and
$B$.
\item Determine the correlation coefficient between $A$ and
$B$.
\item Explain in the context of the question what the
correlation coefficient means.

\item
In production lines, it is important to ensure that the amount of
product placed in containers is not less than the amount
advertised.  However, it is also important that there is not too
much product in the container as this reduces profits.   Balancing
the two criteria requires careful management.

A company selling cordial advertises that the bottles contain two
litres of cordial. In practice, the machine actually fills bottles
with an amount that varies randomly between a minimum of $1.97$
litres and a maximum of $2.07$ litres.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Carefully write down the variable of interest.

\item Write down the sample space for the amount of cordial placed
in the bottles.

\item Could the relative frequency approach to probability be used
to determine the probability that a bottle is underfilled?
Explain your answer.

\item It is found that the actual amount of cordial placed in the
bottles, $C$, follows the probability density function pictured in
Figure~\ref{FG:cordial}. Determine a value for $k$ (preferably
\emph{without} using calculus).

\item Determine the probability that the bottles are underfilled.

\item Calculate the median amount of cordial placed in the
containers.

\item
In meteorological studies, rainfall is often graphed using
rainfall exceedance charts.  In these charts, the plotted function
is $1-F_X(x)$, where $X$ represents the rainfall.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain what is measured by $1-F_X(x)$ in this context, and
explain
      why it may be more useful than just $F_X(x)$ when
      dealing with rainfall.
\item The data in the table below is total monthly rainfall at
      Charleville, Queensland, from 1882 until 1995 for the
      months of June and December. (Data supplied by the Queensland DPI.)
      Plot $1-F_X(x)$ for this rainfall data for each month
      on the same graph.
\item Suppose a producer requires at least 800 mm of rain in June
      to plant a crop.  Find the probability of this occurring from the
      plot above.
\item Determine the median monthly rainfall in Charleville in June
      and December.
\item Decide if the mean or the median is an appropriate measure
of central
      tendency, giving reasons for your answer.
\item Compare the probabilities of obtaining 300mm, 500mm, 1000mm
and
      1500mm of rain in the months of June and December.
\item Write a one page explanation of how to use diagrams like
that
      presented here.  The explanation should be aimed at producers
      (that is, experts in farming, but not in statistics) and
      should be able to demonstrate the usefulness of such graphs in
      decision making.  Your explanation should be clear and without
      jargon.  Use diagrams if necessary.
