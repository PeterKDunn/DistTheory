#  Preface {-}

This book is an introduction to the theory of statistical probability and distributions.


## Statistical software {-}

This book can be read without relying on any specific statistical software, though sometimes **R** code [@R-base] is included to demonstrate ideas.

## How this book was made {-}

This book was made using **R** [@R-base], and the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown], which is based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax, using **knitr** [@R-knitr].



## Learning Outcomes {-}

::: {.objectivesBox .objectives data-latex="{iconmonstr-target-4-240.png}"}
In this book, you will learn to:

* apply rules, theorems and concepts to compute probabilities.
* describe probability and distribution functions.
* apply concepts of mathematical expectation.
* apply and work with standard discrete and continuous distributions, including computing of probabilities.
* apply and work with bivariate and multivariate distributions.
* determine probability functions and distribution functions of transformed radon variables.
* apply and work with standard sampling distributions.
* use **R** to produce relevant plots and compute probabilities.
