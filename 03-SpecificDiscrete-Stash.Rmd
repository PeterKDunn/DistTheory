\section{Self-assessment exercises}

The following exercises are designed to provide practice at problem-solving
based on the material in this module. Solutions are provided at the end of the module.
Additional exercises are available in the next section and in the textbook.

\begin{exercises}

\item Suppose the number of tpyograhpical\footnote{This one was
intentional to keep you alert.} errors on a single page has a
Poisson distribution with $\mu=2$. Assume errors are
independent from page to page. What is the probability that two
pages out of ten will contain no such errors?
\begin{answer}
Let the number of typographical errors be $E$. Then
$E\sim\text{Pois}(2)$. Then, $\Pr{E=0}= \text{E}xp(-2) 2^0/0! = 0.1353$.
Now let $P$ be the number of pages out of 10 with no errors. Then
$P\sim\text{Bin}(n=10, p=0.1353)$ so $\Pr{P=2} = {10\choose 2}(0.1353)^2
(0.8647)^8 = 0.2575$.
\text{E}nd{answer}

\item

A university department has a photocopier security system to track
the number of photocopies made by individual staff members. The
staff members must punch in their access code before being allowed
to make photocopies. The access code consists of any combination
of the ten digits $0$ to $9$, and each staff member can choose any
four digit number.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine how many access codes are possible.
%\item In a department with 25 staff members, each with their own access code,
%      determine the probability that each staff member will choose a
%      unique access code. Assume the staff all pick a four digit
%      number at random.
\item Determine the probability that a randomly chosen access code
      contains more than two digits \text{E}mph{greater} than~6.
\item Comment on how likely it is that the access codes were all
      chosen at random.
\item Determine the number of access codes possible if no digit
      can be repeated.
\text{E}nd{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $10^4$
\item binomial with the probability of choosing a number greater
than 6 being $0.3$ and $n=4$, so answer is $C^4_3 (0.3)^3 (0.7)^1
+ C^4_4 (0.3)^4 (0.7)^0 = 0.0837$
\item unlikely (people use number
easy to remember, such as years of birth); order is important:
$P^{10}_4 = 5040$.
\text{E}nd{enumerate}
\text{E}nd{answer}

\item In Australia, most number plates on cars, trucks and buses
consist of any 3 letters and any 3 numbers. How many vehicles
(cars, trucks and buses) can I expect to pass by me while waiting
to cross the road before I see the letter A on a number plate?

\begin{answer}
Let $A$ be the event `seeing a number plate with an A'. $\Pr{A} =
1 - \Pr{A'} = 1 - (25/26)^3 = 0.1110036$; so the probability is
geometric with $p=0.111$ and the expected number is $1/p = 9$.
\text{E}nd{answer}

\item The number of phone calls received at a real estate firm per
hour has approximately a Poisson distribution with mean $6$.
Determine
\begin{enumerate}
\item the probability that more than ten phone calls will be
received in one hour. \item Suppose the secretary takes a 30
minute lunch break. What is the probability that no calls will be
be received in this time?
\text{E}nd{enumerate}
\begin{answer}
Let $X$ be the number of calls received in one hour; $X\sim
\text{Pois}(6)$. Then $\Pr{X>10} =  1 - \Pr{X\le 10} = 0.0426$. In
half-an-hour, the mean is three phone calls. Let $Y$ be the number
of calls received in half-an-hour; $Y\sim \text{Pois}(3)$. Then
$\Pr{Y=0} = 0.0498$.
\text{E}nd{answer}


\item Example~\ref{EG:prob:wolfdice} gives data on the number of
times each face appears when standard die was rolled. Do the data
appear to come from a discrete uniform distribution? Justify your
answer.
\begin{answer}
Yes---the variations are small enough to be explained by sampling
error.
\text{E}nd{answer}


\item
(Computer exercise) In Section~\ref{SC:CAO} an experiment concerning
21 CAO patients was described. If it is assumed there is no
difference in effect of the two experimental conditions then each
patient represents an independent Bernoulli trial with\\
$\Pr{\text{success}}=\Pr{\text{Patient does better under condition 1}}=0.5$.\\
Using \R\ find $\Pr{X=x}$ ({\sf dbinom}) and $\Pr{X \le x}$ ({\sf 1-pbinom})
for $x=0,1,2,\dots,21$ when $X \sim \text{Bin}(21, 0.5)$
and compare these probabilities to those estimated in Section~\ref{SC:CAO}.\\
(\Note: Simulation won't generally give you the exact theoretical
answer but, provided the sample size is not too small, should give
a reasonable estimate of the true value.)

\begin{answer}
\begin{verbatim}
improve<-0:21
Px<-dbinom(x=improve,size=21,prob=0.5)
PGTx<-pbinom(q=improve,size=21,prob=0.5)
PLTx<-1-PGTx
results<-cbind(improve,Px,PLTx,PGTx)
dimnames(results)<-list(NULL,c("x","P{X=x}","P(X<=x)","P(X>x)"))
print(round(results,4))
\text{E}nd{verbatim}
\text{E}nd{answer}

\item
(Computer exercise) Use the {\sf ppois} function to calculate the
probability
that 5 or more customers will arrive in a half minute interval.
(That is $\Pr{X \ge 5}$).\\
Simulate the arrival of customers in 100 such half minute
intervals and
estimate $\Pr{X \ge 5}$. Compare the true and estimated results. \\
If five customers arrived in a half minute period is there
sufficient evidence to claim that $\mu\ne 2$?

\begin{answer}
\begin{verbatim}
ppois(q=5,mu=2)
sim.results<-table(rpois(n=100,mu=2))
print(sim.results)
\text{E}nd{verbatim}
My results gave
\begin{verbatim}
 sim.results
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6
14 24 27 21  8  4  2
\text{E}nd{verbatim}
There are 2 intervals where at least five customers enter giving an
estimated probability of 0.06. We need to combine categories 5 and 6 so that
 class  frequency is $>$ 5 and large sample theory applies.

This would indicate that it is unlikely
that five (or more) customers would arrive in a half minute interval if in fact
$\mu=2$. We would have reason to suspect that $\mu$ may be
greater than 2 if five (or more) customers arrive in a half minute
interval.\\
(Try it for 1000 intervals, your
estimate should improve.)

\section{Exercises}


\begin{exercises}


\item
In a taste testing experiment $N$ judges are offered four different
brands of orange juice to taste. Suppose $Y$ is the number of judges that
choose brand A as the best .
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down the probability function of $Y$ assuming there is no
difference in taste between the brands.
\item What is the probability that at least one judge chooses brand A?  Use
a calculator to evaluate the expression for $N=10$.\\[2mm]
Use \R\ for parts (c)--(g):
\item If there are 10 judges, simulate 1000 trials
and so estimate $\Pr{Y=y}$ for $i=0,1,2,\dots,10$.\\
\begin{verbatim}
p <- numeric(0)
for (i in 1:1000) {
ChooseA <- sample(c(0,1),size=10,replace=T,prob=c(0.75,0.25))
nA <- sum(ChooseA)
p <- c(p,nA)   }
table(p)/1000
\text{E}nd{verbatim}

\item Estimate $\Pr{Y \ge 6}$. If 6 judges did choose brand A in the taste testing experiment
what conclusion would you come to. Explain.
\item What would you conclude if only one judge chose brand A?
\item Use the following commands to find the exact probabilities in (c),(d) and (e).
\begin{itemize}
\item {\sf dbinom(prob=0.25,x=0:10,size=10)}
\item {\sf pbinom(prob=0.25,q=0:10,size=10)}
\text{E}nd{itemize}
Would your \text{E}mph{conclusions} change in (d) and (e) if you used the exact
probabilities? (The practical advantage of simulation is that provided a large enough sample
size is used the estimated probabilities are usually sufficient and
finding the exact probabilities is unnecessary making it extremely useful in
complex situations.)\\
Graph the pdf and df on the same set of axes.
\text{E}nd{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
(a) See Section~\ref{SC:specdiscrete:binomial} (c) Use {\sf rbinom} (d) Use {\sf pbinom}

Find the variance of the negative binomial distribution
\[ \Pr{Y=y} = {y-1\choose n-1}p^n q^{y-n}\]
where $y=n,n+1,n+2,\cdots,$ and $p+q=1$.

\begin{answer}
First find $\text{E}[Y(Y+1)]=\text{E}(Y^2)+\text{E}(Y)$ using a method similar to that
for finding $\text{E}(Y)$, (Theorem~\ref{TM:negbin}. Then use $\text{var}(Y)E(Y^2)-[\text{E}(Y)^2]$.

a hazardous situation will develop. It is known that on average 1 car enters
the tunnel per 2 minute interval. Write down the probability function,
$\Pr{X=x}$ for $x=0,1,2,\dots$ for the number of cars that enter the tunnel in a {\text{E}m one
minute} period and use the Poisson functions in \R\ to evaluate it for $x=0,1,2,\dots,8$ and graph
the probability function.
\item Find the probability that more than three cars will enter in a 1 minute period.
\item The tunnel is observed for a total of ten (independent) 1 minute periods.

See \ref{SC:pois} with $\mu=0.5$ since interested in intervals of 1 minute.\\
(a) Use $\Pr{X>3}=1-\Pr{X \le 3}$. Ans = 0.001752. (b) Use {\sf ppois}
subcommand. (c) Let $X =$ number of times more than three cars enter tunnel (ie

The gambling game of Keno has become popular recently. In this
game, players pay \$1 and then select numbers between 1 and 80
inclusive. (How many numbers they choose is discussed later.)
Then, a computer selects twenty numbers between 1 and 80
inclusive. Prizes are then awarded depending on how many selected
numbers are in the computers sample of twenty. Players can select
any quantity  of numbers, from just one up to forty.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a player who picks $n$ numbers. Show that the
probability of the player successfully picking $x$ numbers follows
a hypergeometric distribution.
\item Consider a player who decided
to select ten numbers. Determine the probability of having these
ten numbers selected in the computer's sample of twenty.
\item Determine the expected payoff (see Exercise~\ref{QN:payoff}) for
the player in the last question. Successfully selecting ten
numbers from ten wins a maximum of \$2\,000\,000
\item Determine the
expected payoff for successfully selecting one number from one,
five from five, and fifteen from fifteen also. The prizes are \$3,
\$600 and \$250000 respectively. Which strategy has the greatest
expected payoff?
\item For players that select ten numbers, having
seven, eight or nine numbers matching the computers selection wins
\$90, \$900 and \$9000 respectively. Which of these options has
the greatest expected payoff?
\item Write a short discussion on
the statistical aspects of Keno, focusing on the chance of players
winning money on the long term. Your answer should be no more than
6 sentences.
